"I bought my iPhone 12 128gb in blue about 3 weeks ago, and so far it's the best phone I've ever owned! I love this phone and I chose this over the pro because of it's superior battery life, the pro often gets about 10 mins less than this phone because the phone uses more ram. The pro model only has a camera and ram upgrade but this has the same oled screen (excluding 800 nits, the normal gets 625 which is plenty given higher nits causes more energy consumption) fast charging is insanely fast with about 50% in 28 mins - half an hour usually for me, the battery life is a GIANT jump over my 7 (which needed a new battery) I got about 2 hours on the 7 and I now get about 8 hours on this which is a full day for me. I have gotten 157mbps on low band 5g (which is very fast of course for long distance over the air communication) The only bad thing about this phone is that 5g does drain the battery life slightly, but it's not as much as the reviewers complain about.",1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

I don’t like Best Buy at all. I bought a phone from Best But because my son wanted to go there. On December 26 . The phone your associate brought out didn’t even work.

My payment had to be refunded. And they made him pay the. 50.26 cents. Totally unprofessional. This is the third time. I have had issues with your company. I’m at the point now.

And the color's really nice, although you don't really see it with the case on it (except on the back where the camera hole is). It charges fine, but be aware that it comes with a chord but no block. It doesn't work with the old blocks. There's a fast charging block from Apple that works well. We got one from Verizon that works really well too. Both of them charge significantly faster than the old ones did. It's not cheap. We got the extra storage. (It's $50 more to go from 64GB to 128GB, which is well worth it.

I was hesitant to upgrade from my iPhone 11 since it did everything that I needed. But I did it anyway and I’m glad I did. Apple finally gave us an OLED screen on these non-pro models and it’s so nice. Another thing was the 11 was so heavy! This is smaller and lighter. Much better than the 11.

"Couldn’t be happier! I was initially hesitant to go back to such a small phone after having the plus and Max models from the start, but I have been very pleased with the smaller footprint. There is one single downside- the battery. It definitely doesn’t last as long as my previous phone (11 pro max) which was to be expected, but it has been totally manageable. Plus it gives me more incentive to stay off the screen. I hope they continue to make the smaller variant in the future so I’m not forced back into having a large one again.

"Super happy with this purchase and my first iPhone since the 4s. I hope Apple will continue to offer this smaller model; the size is perfect for my hands and pants pockets. Bending over is no longer painful! 
  
  Love the look and very impressed by the cameras once I played with things a little. I’m coming from a Pixel 3 which still takes excellent photos, especially in lower light. But in outdoor lighting the iPhone 12 is definitely an improvement. And video? Night and day. Not even close. I can’t believe how great the footage is that I’m getting on such a small phone. 
  
  The only negative I’ve seen about this phone in reviews - and the only thing that made me hesitant - was the battery size. Honestly, it hasn’t been an issue at all and routinely lasts longer than my Pixel 3 did. I can absolutely get 2 days out of a single charge, no problem. If you’re someone who uses your phone all day long then yeah, a bigger battery will serve you better. But seriously. It’s totally fine for most people. Do not be scared. 
  
  Haven’t tried any MagSafe accessories yet, as it’s not a huge incentive for me and I will say that it’s high time Apple move to USB-C already. Maybe next year... But in the meantime I just use wireless charging mostly and it works great. Very happy with the speed.

"This phone is great. It’s fast, and has a beautiful screen as well as a great camera. I have not upgraded phones for a long time because I did not like the huge mini tablets that phones have become over the years. But I finally upgraded from my iPhone 6 to this iPhone 12 mini because it was the same size as my old phone. 
  
  The only reason I am not giving this review a full 5 stars is because it lacks a headphone jack and a home button. 
  
  To replace the headphone jack for my car stereo, I had to purchase a dongle for my lightning cable which is a tad bit annoying. It’s annoying but still a valid work around. 
  
  As for the home button, sadly, I haven’t fully gotten used to the new way to navigate easily. It’s a bit awkward to transition from app to app since I have to find the “sweet spot” without accidentally clicking a random button or hyperlink. 
  
  Anyway, all in all, it’s a fast phone, and gets the job done for my needs with a little bit of caveat that I hopefully can learn to deal with as time goes on.",0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

  I decided to go with the iPhone 12 mini because it fits better in my pocket, and I felt that I didn't really need the additional screen space. I opted for the convenience of carrying a smaller phone. The screen size is actually slightly larger than that of the 6S, while the overall footprint of the phone is slightly smaller. 
  
  The screen is beautiful, with vibrant but not over saturated colors. It seems to have a much wider brightness range than the old phone. I have taken only a few photos so far, but the camera is a substantial upgrade over my old phone. The phone has done everything I have asked of it so far.

"Got the 12 Mini yesterday. My brain said not to spend my money, but my heart said to do it. I came from an 11 Pro. 
  
  Yes, it’s only been a day. But from the moment I got it, I fell in love with it. I love small phones and this fits perfectly in the hand. It’s fast, has an amazing edge to edge display, Face ID, an awesome camera, and has those lovely square edges. I didn’t like them on the bigger phones, but I absolutely love them on the Mini. Not to mention, the black color is gorgeous. It’s an iPhone so there’s not much more for me to really say about it. 
  
  Cons? Well, battery life. It’s not terrible. But it’s noticeably lower than my 11 Pro. To put it in perspective, I took it off the charger at 7am. It’s currently a little after 9 and I’m at 14%. Approx 5 hours of screen on time. My 11 Pro probably would have had roughly 30-40% still if I remember correctly. With that being said, it was at about 69% at around 1:30 (maybe a little less). Not too bad. 
  
  Because of the battery life, I’m giving this phone 4 stars instead of 5. With small phones come compromises. However, I knew I would take a hit with battery life. Fortunately, it’s definitely manageable- I just had to modify my use a bit. 
  
  And as for 5G... well I only have it in some places. It’s cool to see “5G” on the top right of my screen. That’s about it. But it should be relevant in the future. 
  
  All in all, I’ll say, if you can afford it, and are ITCHING for a small phone with flagship specs, go for the 12 Mini. You won’t regret it. If you’re coming from the 11 series, just be prepared for a hit on battery life. But even the battery isn’t too terrible.",0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"I’m delighted with my iPhone 12 Mini because I wanted a phone that would fit in my shirt pocket. With the smaller notch and lack of a Home button, I have a smaller sized phone with a larger screen — which fits an extra row of icons. The Mini has the same fast processor and OLED screen type as its larger siblings, so it didn’t cut back on capabilities. The one noted cutback is the smaller battery, but I don’t game or stream on my phone, so its shorter battery life has not been an issue for me as I charge less than once a day. Haven’t tested the other improvements, like the supposed stronger glass (I still use a protective case and screen overlay), improved water resistance, 5G, etc.
  It takes a little bit of getting used to the lack of a Home button. Face ID doesn’t work with a mask on, but hopefully that issue will be remedied later this year as the COVID vaccine rolls out.",0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Great features but no good reason at all to not have a charger head or headphones. They have yet to provide tangible evidence that this approach is reducing their carbon footprint.

I like the bigger size that’s why I choose the iPhone 12 pro max . I love the square edges and the color but I would say I love mode if the color gold is over all the phone not just the edge.

For the part I don’t like is they’re not come with the air pods and the usb head plung LoL .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"To deal with the 4 stars 1st, the reasons the A51 I didn't give 5 stars were 1) the length of charging chord is short to the point where you're going to be lucky if you can plug it in and use at the same time if you don't happen to have a chair right next to an outlet and you'll struggle to be able to plug in and have the phone on a bedside table. 2) The second reason is not particularly significant to me, but I do wonder if the battery life may be shorter than a heavy streaming content user would like. Other than those 2 points, I can't fault the phone for an everyday user. There are a lot of you tube vids for this phone that take little digs here and there. For example, the camera is great for 95% of users who are just doing their normal Facebook/Instagram stuff. However, the micro dissection on youtube would make you think it stinks. Those videos are total garbage by idiots who try to impress us with technical knowhow, but probably do no more than take selfies with the cats and stuff like that as does everyone else.",1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"I have been a Samsung Galaxy phone user for many years. I recently upgraded my Note 8 for the A71 5G UW after researching my options. This phone was a great choice (with the two exceptions noted below) for the price. It has a Snapdragon 765G and 8 Gigs of Ram, more than enough power and room to do the daily tasks I ask of a phone. While I thought I would miss the S-pen with the Note 8, I have found that not to be the case. The size is just right for me compared to the Note 8, and the screen seems brighter and clearer than the Note 8 was. The battery is awesome in this phone. With my normal usage, I could probably get two days before needing to charge. Speaking of charging, the super-fast charger can take my phone from 15% to full in about 68 minutes! That's fast. Now to the exceptions: First, this phone does not have wireless charging, and I miss that. I tried a plug-in adapter for the USB-C port that enables the phone to charge wirelessly, but it is hard to get the phone to lie on the charger correctly to enable the phone to actually charge. It's too easy to move the phone enough to make it stop charging. Also, this method is much slower than the charger that came with the phone. Second, this phone has an FM radio built-in, but nothing I have tried to use this feature works. I'm told by Samsung that it is in the phone and also by Verizon, but I'm also told that it must be disabled by Verizon with their software. I can't get any app to actually work with the FM radio (NextRadio being what I used on my old phone). It must be something with the software Verizon uses with the 5G UW variant of the phone. I miss being able to listen to radio when I'm outside - without using data. Overall, I am pleased with the A71 5G UW. It seems to be a well-built phone that is hard to beat when it comes to price.",0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

"About a month into ownership, the phone appears to be another solid Samsung product. After familiarizing myself with the newer operating system and figuring out how I wanted to use it, I turned off or controlled data usage for a lot of ""unnecessary"" background processes and have been easily going 4 to 5 days between battery recharges. (I'll see how battery life holds up over time with software updates) Pro's:
 *The camera is great compared to my old phone. (love the integrated ""Scan"" feature for documents. )
 *Hands-free voice/audio quality seems very good. 
 *No problems pairing to my cars . . . so far. 
 *Great screen . . . resolution, brightness, outside visibility are all good. 
 * Great overall speed . . . good multi-core processor for how I use a smartphone. (Note : I don't spend hours playing games ... no time for that ... 2 college tuitions to help pay) Cons:
 *There are still limited case choices for the 5G Verizon version. (It has a slightly modified case to accomodate the internal tech)
 *I never had a larger phone like this and suspect it might get a little awkward to carry during the summer with lighter clothing. 
 *This may sound picky, but the ""Snooze"" button is small on the alarm clock and I haven't bothered to look for an alternate app yet. This is an OS / Application short-coming and shouldn't be considered an A71 issue. Notes: Even though I bought this phone b/c I wanted the 5G capability, I found that I don't have that service at my house and I haven't had a change to test it. I've probably used it during my commute for voice calls, but have never verified / confirmed that. Summary : Very happy!! . . . great product so far. I seemed to get about 98% of the performance and features of a S20/21 for about 40%+/- of the cost.",1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1

"The phone itself is very nice. I would give it 5 stars if I were reviewing just the phone. Transferring the data from my old phone was easy. Picture quality is exceptional. Battery life is SO much better. (this was the reason for purchasing a new phone). I have no real complaints about the phone other than the constant attempt for me to set up a fingerprint sign in. The problem comes in with the Best Buy service department. Upon receiving my phone, all was well until I noticed a very small nick on my screen, which quickly, developed into a substantial crack. The phone had not been dropped or anything dropped on it. It was in a case with bumpers on the corners for protection since I took it out of the box. I can only suspect there was an unnoticeable crack already there upon receipt. At this point, the phone had been in my possession a week. So, I went online to the chat, explained the situation, was assured by two different representatives that this would be covered by the 14 days repair or return policy of Best Buy. I made an appointment to go into the closest store to me (45 minutes away), only to be treated as a liar (I MUST have done the damage myself) and told they could not replace the phone for me. I explained that I did not want a replacement phone, just wanted the screen either repaired or replaced. I told the manager, if it wasn’t applicable under their policy, I would just pay to have it done. THEN, I was informed that they did not work on Android phones in the store, only iPhones, and was referred to a local repair shop. This would have been nice to know up front, as I told each representative that I chatted with the exact model of my phone. I mentioned this to the manager and told him that Best Buy should make sure that their online representatives should be better educated in their policy details, only to be told, “oh, well, you could have been talking to anyone, anywhere, maybe even in Minnesota.” I fail to see why that would be relevant to the situation. I would assume Best Buy’s policies are the same, no matter where you live. In closing, let me just say that this is the third phone I have purchased from Best Buy. This is the first one I have purchased online and had shipped to me. Prior to this, I have had no problems, so was not involved with the Geek Squad for anything. I was not impressed with their service. Perhaps it was just this particular store. (located at 3750 SW Archer Rd, Gainesville, FL, 32608). I would like to think so. So, this is the reason for only a three stars rating. I am an honest person and did not appreciate the attitude of the people I dealt with.",1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1

"I have loved Samsung products for years and have been waiting for this phone for years, I've been a Galaxy Note fan since the 2nd one, this would have been the perfect phone if you say that if the s pen could have been added, but this is a great phone for technical reasons and for daily use, it's wonderful, its smaller in my pocket than the note 10 plus but when open its like my 8 inch Samsung tablet, so for work its a power house, for play many hours of entertainment, and its tougher than I thought so you don't have to baby it, camera is great as usual from Samsung, I can get a few days of battery on the powerful setting and more with power saving on, speakers are loud, screen looks great, watching TV and videos, and games is like having a small flat screen in your hands, it's a little heavier than my note 10 plus but not an issue it feels great in hand, and I can operate it with one hand without putting it in the mode, I've had it for a moth now I don't have any bad things to say about it, yeah the price is higher but the phone is beautiful and its different, I like different things at times, of your not worried about price I pay $50 a month my note 10 was $46, not bad, I say get it, you will like once its in your hands, maybe after I have it longer I can do another review.",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

The unfortunate reality for this device is the fact that it’s to far ahead of its time. While the device runs brilliantly it is held so far behind by the fact that the majority of third party apps aren’t optimized for it that you can’t help but feel that it’s not worth the money. Snapchat can’t adjust for the funky picture resolution so your friends complain about misformated pictures. Instagram basically runs the size of an iPhone max screen because it’s not optimized. While Samsung cannot control how these other parties run their companies in a sense you’d expect a company the size of Samsung to have more of a say. I ended up decided to return this phone and go back to the wall paintings of Apple that is familiar and optimized.,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1

The multi-tasking is awesome as you can have up to found apps running at once but you probably will only run two most of the time. Only trouble as of now is finding quality cases for it. I have a slim armor pro Spigen case and its the best I have found. Another con is when you don't use it in tablet mode the screen can be hard to use if you have bigger fingers.

The S21+ is not that impressive. I only got a new phone because of charging issues with my last one. The store did my set-up and transferring of all of my data which was helpful but I still lost some very important photos. Not all of my apps transferred over so had to spend time remembering everything I had on the old phone. I did do a trade in and I will never do that again. This phone also does not have the expandable memory which is one of the reasons I buy Samsung and not apple.

"The Phone Is EZ to Work but let me admit, I DID come out of another Samsung ( 9S+ 64G). The Folding Function makes it a bit bulkier (when Folded) but not as much as one would think. When Opened?? Its a dream! But the BIG 'pay off' of having a (Mind blowing) DOUBLE Wide Viewing Screen FAR Exceeds the little extra bulkiness. The Camera? Whew!! CRISP! It'll put a professional photographer out of business...SERIOUSLY!! (FYI? I'm a professional photographer!!) The battery life is GREAT! I use the phone ALL day fr 10 -12 hours without losing the initial charge. The Ugly? Obviously the $2k Price tag and the fact it didn't come with a basic case to protect an investment of this price? In my opinion a 'mis step for Samsung. Let me Add that Best Buy Didnt have Case or Screen protector in stock for a $2k Phone? At the point of purchase I was promised that I have both to my home address in 2 days. They took over a week! That to me? Bad business on BOTH Samsungs AND Best Buy. Bottom Line? I ABSOLUTELY LOVE the Phone and I was enticed MOSTLY by the double wide screen & the 256GB of storage. (BTW?) No Memory card slot? Thats another Mis-Step.

"This phone is a beast! Major upgrade from last year, the front screen is totally functional on its own. There may be some adjusting due to the narrow display and keyboard, but I don't find this an issue, and this comes from someone with very large hands. Once the phone is unfolded, it feels like a completely different experience. The real-estate is and usability is mind blowing. I personally don't have many complaints about the phone itself. I'm coming from a note 8, one thing I do notice is; using the phone closed, there is a noticeable weight increase and is very blocky when in pocket, but most phones are nowadays. The hinge is very sturdy and the device has an excellent build. Be careful with the inner screen, although it does come with a screen protector supplied by Samsung, it still feels fragile.

"While this phone meets the specs and has good future-proof features, I honestly can't stand this phone. Google has basically taken all the worst features and made them impossible to remove or disable. The camera is fine, the screen is large and very nice, there's no doubt there. However, I can't use my non-gmail email without installing an after-market app that I don't trust, nor do I want to link my real email to a gmail account. The finger sensor is on the back is weird, it works, but that's definitely a poor place to put that. The worst is the inability to alter the home screen because fixes the google search bar at the bottom, which is just a terrible location for it. Even worse, you'll need to watch like 5 tutorials to change how apps look, how the keyboard behaves etc. I'll keep it, but I'm not happy with this purchase.

  Simple things like video picture in picture are now limited, so you can't put them in the center of the screen. Multiple games look horribly pixilated, whereas on other Android phones with 90hz displays look amazing. Settings are rearranged from standard android, for no reason. Great camera, fast apps, but many compromises.

"I love this phone! Upgraded from the Pixel 3a and haven't looked back. Faster processing, more RAM, 128GB of storage, and better speaker audio are just some of the huge improvements. Comes preloaded with Android 11 but you'll have a few security updates. Call quality and data speeds on 5G are excellent as well. Not a fan of Samsung and Apple phones so this is a great alternative, if not better in some aspects. Wanted to compare this phone to the OnePlus Nord N10 phone but it was too new for real time assessments but overall specs were better on the Pixel. My only dislike is purely aesthetic because it only comes in 1 color. Highly recommended phone for those who want an unlocked 5G phone at half the price.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Best Camera phone with excellent stabilization! This Pixel 4a 5G is Mid range phone but in practice it's high range phone. I prefer fingerprint sensor on backside during this pandemic.

"I've only had it about a month, but so far, so good. I like that I can use it with the Verizon 5G network (just not the UW5G, which I honestly don't need), but without paying the extra $100 that Verizon charges for their UW5G version. This is an upgrade for me from the Pixel 2, which Google has stopped updating/supporting. Hopefully, they will support this version for a couple years, as all the data I could find indicated that it should be good at least through the android-14 update. As for the change from P-2 to this P-4a5G, no complaints, it has been very easy because they are so similar. Everything (pictures, contacts, texts, apps, etc.) transferred easily to the new phone during activation and setup, nothing special was required. This phone is much faster online and stays on (whereas my P-2 had started shutting down very frequently); the camera is touted to be better, which I can't speak to as it seems to work fine for my needs...as did the P-2 camera until the phone started shutting off every time I tried to take a photo.

"This phone is ok. It's my second pixel that I upgraded from pixel 2. I really like the pixel 2 and thought this would be as nice. It's alright. I don't think the camera is as good, but idk. The night sight setting is not as good as they claim it to be. PIctures came out grainy. The pixel 2 just point and shoot and it did everything for you. It overheated FAST!! I was on a road trip and was listening to spotify on the phone and using the maps, the car did not have android auto or blue tooth hook up. Anyways, it overheated and shut off. I had to pull over and wait for the phone to cool down, then needed to have the fan on in the car the rest of the way just to keep the phone from overheating. I drove in silence after that. 
  
  It's not a very big phone like the pixel 3 XL or those big giant Iphone. It fits in my cargo pocket well (i'm a nurse with cargo pockets on my scrubs), but if you put it in your jacket pocket, keep a hand on it. Might fall out.

"As someone who knows phones very well, I can definitely say that this phone did not disappoint.

  The 65 watt warp charging is phenomenal but I do wish it worked with other fast chargers available from other companies. I also wasn't sure if I would like a curved screen, but the curve is so minor you never really even notice

The transfer of data from the Moto One Action to this phone is anything but flawless. If you know how to manually setup your accounts and move your data and messages manually, just get right to it. It will be faster and less prone to errors. Finally and probably my biggest complaint is a NON STANDARD CHARGER! You cannot charge this phone with any existing charger!

"This is my favorite android phone on the market, save two downsides which you need to be ok with. 
  
  Pros:
  - New prices that have dropped this to $899 128GB make it a great value
  - The cameras are excellent. The 3x and 10x are class-leading for a phone. Don't expect the same quality as with the regular lens. 
  - 120hz is phenomenal. Everything so fast! 
  - One UI 3.1 is great. Closer and closer to stock android with helpful additions like side bar
  - Beautiful screen
  - Openness of android
  
  Cons
  - the disabling of the eSim is huge for me, not a big deal for both. I always use two lines on my iPhone and Pixel, and the Samsung forces me to carry two phones

"*** Summary ***
  
  For $500, you’re getting a superb mid-range phone with a thoughtful balance of hardware components coupled with excellent software directly from Google. The three cameras take top-level photos and videos, and the screen is big, bright, and crisp for an enjoyable multimedia and reading experience. With support for both 4G and 5G connectivity, as well as three years of software updates from Google, the phone is more future-proof than most competing devices. It’s a great bang-for-your-buck and a 5-star win!

  === Design, Build Quality, and Specs ===
  
  The Pixel 4a 5G, like the Pixel 3a mid-range phone from last year, is a simply-looking and unassuming device. The Pixel 4a exudes a clean look, has soft and rounded corners and sides for a comfortable and ergonomic feel in-hand, and although it’s heavily plastic, the fit-and-finish is excellent with no blemishes. Everything from the port to the speaker cut-outs, alignment and texture of the buttons on the right side, the rear camera hump, the slightly recessed fingerprint reader on the back, and all of the seams between the front glass and the phone casing are meticulously even. Although it doesn’t feel “premium” in-hand due to no metal or hardened glass on the back, the plastic material is of higher-than-average quality and it’s dense, smooth, and offers some grip. If the Pixel 4a 5G were a >$800 almost-flagship level phone, I would expect and want more. But at the $500 level, the build materials and quality are more than just fine, especially if you’re just going to put a case on it after the initial unboxing adoration and feel-over sessions are over. :)
  
  I’m quite satisfied with the hardware I’m getting at this price point - a Snapdragon 765G SOC with 6GB of RAM (fast and responsive), 6.2” OLED screen (bright and big), 128GB UFS 2.1 storage (fast file transfers and loading times), 4G & 5G radios (future-proof), a fingerprint sensor (fast and consistent), and three excellent cameras (12.2MP main rear, 16MP ultra-wide rear, 8MP front). 
  
  Do I wish the Pixel 4a 5G offered more? Sure, like wireless charging, an IP water-resistance rating, Wi-Fi 6, and a higher screen refresh rate like 90Hz or 120Hz. But those things would’ve added hundreds of dollars more to the cost and, frankly, they’re nice extras to have but not absolute necessities. 
  
  Looking over the design, build quality, and hardware specs of the Pixel 4a 5G, I think Google performed an excellent balancing act when finalizing the phone for this price point. 
  
  === Hardware & Software Performance ===
  
  The performance and responsiveness levels of the Pixel 4a 5G are nothing to write home about but I was pleasantly surprised by how good it was, especially when compared to my Pixel 3a and Samsung Galaxy S20+ 5G. When the Pixel 4a 5G was put through some benchmarks against the Pixel 3a, it was 70% faster in Geekbench 5 single-core and 30% faster in multi-core. 3DMark Wildlife gave the Pixel 4a 5G a 55% win in both the total score and frame rates. PCMark 2.0 Work 2.0 gave only a slight edge to the Pixel 4a 5G (15%) but the PCMark Storage test saw a huge improvement of 49% (most likely due to UFS 2.1). 
  
  These benchmark numbers, when translated into real-life usage, meant that the Pixel 4a 5G felt much more responsive, snappier, and faster than the Pixel 3a, and not too much slower than my Galaxy S20+ during normal usage (web browsing, watching videos, social media, texting, multi-tasking, etc). When playing graphic-intensive games, however, the Pixel 4a 5G got smoked by the Galaxy S20+, as expected. If you aren’t a hardcore smartphone gamer, then this is a non-issue. 
  
  The phone came preloaded with the latest Android 11 operating system and it’s clean-looking, intuitive, and responsive. Compared to more feature-heavy OS’s like Samsung’s OneUI 2.5, there are fewer bells and whistles, which some may bemoan. For instance, I was frustrated that I couldn’t even create folders inside the app drawer or hide app icons. Thankfully, installing 3rd-party launchers is still an option so I swapped to Novalauncher after putting up with the default launcher for three days. 
  
  Google may not offer many out-of-the-box customization options in general but it offers some Pixel-exclusive features that are quite nice, such as Automatic Call Screening, the most advanced version of Google Assistant AI, and the fancy Recorder app for voice transcriptions and note-taking. 
  
  Besides the lack of customization options from the default launcher, there is nothing else I can fault about Android 11 on the Pixel 4a 5G. It’s fast, stable, and intuitive to use with no major bugs. 
  
  
  === Connectivity ===
  
  The main selling point of the Pixel 4a 5G over the Pixel 4a and other mid-range devices is that it has 5G connectivity. After testing out 5G over both Sprint and T-Mobile’s networks, I walked away both impressed and sort of underwhelmed. I was pleasantly surprised by the reliability and signal strength of 5G around me but I was disappointed that my speeds didn’t improve by much and felt like regular 4G LTE. 5G is still actively rolling out so I’m expecting things to get more exciting later. 
  
  
  === Camera & Video Quality ===
  
  Just as I expected, photos and videos taken from the Pixel 4a 5G were highly satisfactory and competent. The colors were accurate with good dynamic range, and Google’s AI wizardry captured the subject matter with great focus and detail. I turn on HDR mode at all times and Google’s algorithm did a fantastic job highlighting the differences in contrast while preserving natural colors and small details. Google has created a great camera system and I feel confident that most people will be 100% satisfied by its quality and consistency. 
  
  My only gripes are that once in a while, the auto-focus loses track of my subject resulting in a blurry shot (for both photos and videos), and that low-light photo processing times feel a bit too long, resulting in missed opportunities. I’m hopeful that Google will release app updates to improve these areas. 
  
  === Is it a good buy? ===
  
  Yes! If you’re set on spending no more than $500 for a smartphone, then the Pixel 4a 5G is a very compelling choice with good value. You get a decent set of hardware that offers good performance and long battery life, excellent cameras, and the latest version of Android OS and Pixel exclusives straight from Google for three years guaranteed. With 128GB of fast internal storage, 5G connectivity, and a big and bright 6.2” screen, I think it’s both a sensible and worthy investment.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1

"This is a three-star phone at best, on the best day ever. I paid $179.99 for it, but even if this were just a flat $200, I'd call it overpriced. 
  
  This phone lags, and has stuttery animations everywhere, so get ready for that. You can improve the framedrops some by installing a third party launcher like Nova launcher, which I have done. It improves the experience some in that regard, but still doesn't completely mitigate it. Also, it doesn't fix the really bad lag when it comes to opening applications. Just to drive the point home on how bad the stutter and lag is, this phone has a 90Hz refresh rate, but I had no idea that it was on (or even had it) until double checking the settings, because the phone's performance makes it look just like any other 60Hz display on a phone. Even so, I've seen 60Hz displays on phones that look smoother than this one. 
  
  The camera is very mediocre, but does work for taking pictures, and for the price, I can't complain about that. Just be aware that this camera does not take great photos, it just takes photos. 
  
  I don't have any other comments. Really just that the camera is passable, and the performance is really bad, but can be improved slightly by installing a third party launcher. 
  
  If you want a phone in this kind of price range, but want a far superior experience, I would look into something like the Xiaomi Poco X3. All in all, just don't buy this one.

You may want to wait until 5g matures before purchasing a 5g phone unless you don't mind dropped calls and data loading in between 4 and 5g.,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"To start off, all the technical information regarding the Pixel 4a 5G can be found at Google’s store website. Some of the more detailed info can be found at various websites as well with a simple search. It’ll help to better understand some of the things mentioned here. For easier reference, I’ll be using “4a5G” to refer to the Google Pixel 4a 5G. 
  
  The 4a5G positions itself between the Pixel 4a and the Pixel 5. The reason is because of the phone’s support for 5G carrier signals. While you do pay a price premium over the Pixel 4a ($150 worth), the cost is a little more than just 5G support. 
  
  Physically, the 4a5G is a tad larger than the Pixel 5, Google’s latest and highest end model for 2020. While the screen looks good despite a slightly less pixel density (and due to a slightly bigger screen), it lacks the high refresh rate (90Hz) that the Pixel 5 offers. However, the majority of people looking into getting a new phone are using phones that have standard 60Hz screens. Missing out on the 90Hz refresh rate would not be an issue. The biggest disappointment would definitely be the screen glass. The 4a5G uses Gorilla Glass 3 whereas the majority of 2020 phones, uses newer Gorilla Glass 5 (and the high-end using Gorilla Glass 6). Newer iterations of the glass are designed to be more resistant to breaking or cracking on impact, something that tends to happen often enough that people put a screen protector regardless of how good it is. And because it is using an older iteration, it’s recommended to get a protector as soon as possible as well as a decent phone case. 
  
  Inside, the hardware is almost identical to the fancier Pixel 5. There is 6GB of RAM compared to the 5’s 8GB. I also question this as a cost cutting measure. While there is a definite need to differentiate itself from the 5, memory should not be one of them. Software will always grow in complexity and maturity. And in order to bring out the best of the apps that we use, more memory is better. It also helps in keeping some apps open in the background so we can return to it later, saving us a little bit of time because the phone doesn’t need to load the entire app into memory again. I would rather not sacrifice memory to justify meeting the MSRP target. 
  
  Another piece missing is wireless charging. While many people may not care much for wireless charging, you cannot deny that it is becoming a common feature in phones at various price points. The lack of wireless charging is a minus given that Apple’s iPhone SE 2020 even has it, and that costs a single Benjamin less than the 4a5G. 
  
  Lastly, the phone lacks water resistance (or a water resistance certified rating). I think this is a major minus these days because of how we take our phones virtually everywhere. And there’s always that off chance the phone may end up taking a dip in the water. With no certified IP rating for water resistance, it means that bringing the phone to the pool, your bathroom, or wherever is very risky. Again, the fruity competitor’s phone comes with water resistance yet cost less. This is a big no-no for me if you need a practical phone that you can take with you. 
  
  For the past several years, Google has carved a spot in creating the best photos with a phone camera. In the years since its first Pixel phone release, the competition has had time to catch up. Now the gap in image quality and color accuracy has shrunk. It’s to the point where the competition can come close or match what the Pixel phones can do. However, the difference is that you may end up paying more for that competing picture quality. The great thing about Google’s camera system is that the hardware hasn’t changed but rather it’s the software that continues to improve. 
  
  Of the sample photos I’ve taken, the image quality is what I’ve come to expect from Google. The colors are good and the image quality, even in low light, are excellent. Portrait photos taken on the selfie front facing camera is great and recognizes the edges around me well. The only disappointment is perhaps the decision or quality on the wide angle lens. Even though it is supposed to provide a bigger/wider view, the sample photos I’ve taken with its Night Sight feature turned out to be worse. Taking wide angle shots with ample lighting didn’t appear to exhibit this odd quirk/flaw. Seeing that the majority of use cases for wide angle photography will be taken with ample lighting, perhaps this is a non-issue. 
  
  On video recording, I did not see any problem when taking a quick recording. The video stabilization also makes panning your shots smooth. It also can handle 4k 60fps recording which is a nice bonus. Recording at 1080p is limited to either 30fps or 60fps. I’ll nitpick here and say that Google should allow 120fps recording at 1080p since the phone is capable of handling 4k 60fps. At least it’s nice seeing that it can handle 4k 60fps. 
  
  I should not be pointing this out as a feature, as I still hold a grudge with Google on their decisions with the headphone jack. It is there for people who still use the tried and true headphones of their choice. It is convenient as it allows people to use the headphones of choice while also charging at the same time. 
  
  One of the best aspects of a Google Pixel phone is how smooth the experience is. There is no carrier-specific bloatware. No duplicate apps like a certain other major Android phone maker. It is the purest Android experience. Setting up the phone is straightforward and guides you through the steps. Once it’s done, you’re left with a clean home screen and the basic default apps to get started. Having used Android for many years, it has become second nature for me to know how to navigate around it. The experience is just like how I remembered -- smooth, flexible, and customizable. And the perk of using a Pixel phone is being the first to get security updates as well as major Android updates. But comparing it to a certain fruity competitor, Google still falls way short in this regard. That competitor is able to support hardware that dates back 5 years, which is 2 years longer than Google’s offering. Google should provide the same level of support if it wants to be competitive in the smartphone market. Aside from that, there are things within its stock Android software that sets it apart from other Android phones -- Pixel specific features. There's one that I tried for the first time on a Pixel phone -- call screening. It allows you to let Google Assistant to answer the call for you and transcribe in real time so you don't have to answer it yourself. And if the call is legit, you can pick it up and speak to the caller yourself. It's one of the perks to owning a Pixel phone that makes it worthwhile to have. 
  
  Testing the phone’s 5G capability has been rather tricky and at times difficult. Attempting to test this at home turned out to be a bad idea. For a baseline reference, 4G LTE speed varies between 20-30Mbps for download speed and 1.5 to 5Mbps for upload. This was done using T-Mobile’s network. At home, speeds vary between 45Mbps to 57Mbps for download and 3Mbps to 4.8Mbps for upload. To me that’s a very small gain and didn’t seem indicative of what 5G is supposed to be. On the way back from a small errand, I ran a single speed test. The result is 159Mbps for download and 16.3Mbps for upload. This is a drastic improvement and shows the potential for 5G. The wireless tech is still new and thus it will take time to proliferate and propagate. This isn’t to say that it’s not worth getting the phone for 5G. Rather, it’s a nice feature to have and adds a bit of future proofing to the phone. And conditions for 5G will only improve as time passes. 
  
  Overall, the Pixel 4a 5G is a nice phone that brings most of the basic necessities at an affordable price. However, I question the omission of water resistance and wireless charging as well as its use of Gorilla Glass 3 as the reason to differentiate itself from the flagship model. If a certain competitor is able to include wireless charging and water resistance at a lesser cost, I failed to see why it’s not included. Yet if you omit these flaws, the 4a 5G is a great phone for taking pictures without having to spend a lot. And with 3 years of major Android updates, the value becomes better and will help stem the need to upgrade the phone every so often. 
  
  The Good: Camera and image quality, stock Android, Pixel-only features, first to get major updates and monthly security patches, 3 years of major Android updates (from release date)
  
  The Bad: old Gorilla Glass tech compared to other 2020 phones, 3 years of Android update vs 5+ years on Apple phone, no wireless charging, no water resistant rating/certification
  
  The Ugly: Google’s design choices over the years

"I miss the flip phone days when you charged your phone once a week. Unfortunately, we've gone from that to charging daily. The Pixel 4a 5G is a huge improvement. I'm not a really heavy user, but I can go almost three days on a charge. That's about a day better than the best smartphones out there. It could be because of Android 11, which installed on day one. Since we don't have 5G in my area, I haven't been able to test battery life on the new network, but I'm pretty sure it will decrease slightly. 
  
  Speaking of Android 11, one of the nice things about Google phones is you get completely stock Android--no launchers or other software that can slow the phone down. And this phone is fast. I've not seen any lag at all. 
  
  The camera is excellent, giving accurate colors in good light, and good pictures in low light situations, as well. 
  
  The AMOLED screen is bright and colors pop. And I've been very impressed with the speaker. It gives sufficient volume without sounding tinny like most smartphone speakers. 
  
  The only issue I've noticed so far is that sometimes apps open in landscape mode and there is a lag before rotation is corrected. I'm sure that's a software issue and will be fixed in the near future. 
  
  In my opinion, this phone has all the features you could want in current smartphones. And it's half the price of other flagship phones.",1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

"This phone is really a great value compared to other flagship phones. I originally had a Pixel 5, but decided for the money this phone is a better value.

Another feature that would have been nice to have is for it to be water resistant, but I can't remember the last time I really needed it.

"I picked this one up not expecting much with it being OnePlus' lowest-end offering, but I was pleasantly surprised by how much of what I'd assume is the flagship OnePlus experience had carried over to their most affordable offering. Haven't used a OnePlus phone since the One, but this wasn't as bad of a second first impression as the reviews online lead me to believe at first. Almost everything I'd like to see out of a phone is present and accounted for here. There's a surprisingly pretty 90hz display up front, the back panel is absolutely beautiful and looks very premium, and the main camera's performance is actually quite decent for a device in this price range. There's a charger in the box, a headphone jack, and an SD card slot, none of which you really see these days- not even the last two are present in OnePlus' more expensive devices! 
  
  My main peeves with this device are the limited software support, the unsightly chin on the display, the awful vibration motor, and the lack of an ultra-wide angle camera. This phone is only going to get one update to Android 11 and after that it'll only receive security updates until 2022. The vibration motor is flubby and weak, which is a shame considering some phones in a similar price range have much better motors with strong and tight vibration feedback. Finally, the lack of an ultra-wide camera really rubs me the wrong way- I mean, really? Instead of a nearly useless depth camera, they probably could've added an ultra-wide lens at a lower resolution. The macro camera is alright and does make for some fun shots, but I'd rather only have the regular and ultrawide cameras on the back so the camera bump can be smaller/slimmer.",1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

"Google nailed it with this phone. Google phones at first glance seem to not make sense when compared to the specs of other phones released in their class but when you put them to real life use, they are so relevant. 
  
  -Perfec size and weight. 
  -Fantastic battery life. 
  -Beautiful screen. 
  -Speedy and snappy. The 765g processor is efficient and more than enough for everyday usage. 
  -Headphone jack! 
  -Fast fingerprint scanner which is really appreciated in this era of face masks. 
  -128gb of onboard storage. 
  -Smooth UI with no added bloatware like other android phones. 
  -Always had great still shot cameras but video footage is ridiculously high quality (4k 30/60 on rear cameras). Stabilization is among the best in any high end flagship. 
  
  Only con for me is no 4k 30/60 on front facing camera which is not a deals breaker at all. Also 5g is overrated so I leave it on LTE which makes the battery even better. I'm getting over 10hrs screen on time consistently.

"I really wanted to like this phone. I love that it has a headphone jack, I love that it runs a mostly bloat-free and ad-free version of Android (in recent years, many Android phonemakers have basically ruined Android on their phones by filling it with needless apps and features), I love the camera quality (despite it lacking a telephoto camera),and I love that the bootloader can be unlocked meaning you can root the phone or flash custom ROMs. This is super useful for people that like more control over their device or intend to keep their phone past the window of provided software support. 
  
  The problem is that this phone is simply built like trash. It's made from plastic. I personally don't think any phone, budget or flagship, should be made from plastic. I simply refuse to understand why this phone is $500 and made from plastic when the iPhone SE (2020) is made from premium aluminum and glass and actually costs less and has a faster processor. There is no excuse for making an appliance that most people use everyday out of such a cheap material. Google is absolutely taking their customers for a ride and overcharging for their devices. 
  
  What else is wrong with this phone? The screen is absurdly dim. I could barely make out icons or text on a sunny day without maxing the brightness and after a few moments, the autobrightness would lower it back to a point of unreadability. 
  
  I also very much dislike the hole punch camera cutout. I think notches and camera cutouts are a solution in search of a problem. It's a hideous black dot marring the otherwise edge-to-edge display. The only positive thing I can say about the camera cutout is that it is in the left corner rather than the center of the screen. Many other phonemakers have started putting hole punch cameras right in the middle of the phone and it's immensely distracting when gaming or watching videos. Thank you to Google for at least putting it in the corner where it's less obtrusive. 
  
  I think Google deserves praise for software support, cameras, and allowing bootloader unlocking. Everything else about this phone is pretty bad. I returned it.",1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1

The night mode and the astrophotography mode are absolutely ridiculous. I would only be able to count out a few stars with my eyes and after snapping a picture with this phone it captured hundreds of stars. This phone has it all. You won't be missing the wireless charging because it charged faster with the wired 18W charging. This battery lasts me all day easily. The display gets bright and the OLED panel is great. You can easily get 7-8 hours out of this phone to last you throughout the whole day. This phone is the best value for money out there right now. If you can get it while discounted it'll be an absolute steal.

"Cell phones. Can't be without one, but you can't seem to pocket them easily anymore.

  I moved the 4a 5G from a Pixel 3a. More RAM, Storage and the Pixel 5 camera, what's not too like? 5G? Well, guess it depends on where you live, and it really wasn't a factor for me. I do happen to get a consistent 5G signal, which is nice, but I don't do a lot f things where I notice the speed difference. 
  
  Build quality is nice. You know the drill with Pixels. Gorilla Glass up front, plastic on the back. Nothing fancy, and it doesn't need to be. Stock Android (mine already updated to 11) with no trash apps preinstalled. Camera? Well, it's a Pixel, so you know it's going to be good. No crazy amount of lenses that you will likely never use, just. standard and wide angle and that's enough. Unbeatable low light images. 
  
  Battery life? In a word....EXCELLENT. Now, I am not what you would call a power user. I make a few calls, send txt messages, watch youtube, facebook and plenty of random google searches. I can easily charge every other day. So is this phone for you?

My only complaint is that is doesn't seem to have the long/scrolling screenshot feature some phones do, but I wouldn't consider it a deal breaker, and the screen lock button is above the volume, which makes taking screenshots one handed using them difficult.

"There is a lot to like about this phone and I believe it’s probably the best US flagship 5G smartphone on the market currently. Build quality is excellent, the phone’s beautiful exterior is lovingly crafted with metal and glass, no cheap plastic materials. Specs are among the best of any Android smartphone and OnePlus has designed a new cooling system for the device to keep it cool. 
  
  Cameras are excellent, and this is coming from somebody who’s last phone was a Pixel device. I’ve owned previous OnePlus phones as well (OnePlus 7 Pro and OnePlus 8T) and the camera is in another league. Way less shutter lag that previous phones, clearer photos, excellent portrait mode, and support for 4k 120FPS video (which is stunning). Optical image stabilization works wonderfully as well. A minor grievance is that I don’t like the Hasselblad logo on the camera bump, I understand that the two companies have a partnership but I’m not a fan of excessive branding on my devices (especially if it’s from a partner company). It’s worth noting that Sony (not Hasselblad) actually supplies the camera sensors for this phone. 
  
  The phone supports 60w wired charging and is absurdly fast to charge. 15w EPP Qi charging and 50w proprietary wireless charging are also supported. Personally, I have no interest in the 50w proprietary wireless charger (it’s expensive and gets the phone quite toasty from what I’ve heard) but Qi support is a nice touch for people who enjoy using wireless charging as a mere supplement to wired charging or for the rare event that you have a mishap with your charging port. Battery life has been slightly better than I’ve experienced on previous OnePlus devices with 6 hours or more screen on time before I feel the need to plug in. 
  
  Device stability is good, I have not experienced any issues with bugs, overheating, or crashes. The underscreen fingerprint sensor works flawlessly every time (OnePlus has the best optical fingerprint readers in the industry as far as I’m concerned) and is very convenient. Sound from the phone’s speakers is loud and crisp. Haptic feedback feels good. 
  
  Despite this praise, the phone isn’t perfect. For one, it lacks a headphone (3.5mm audio) jack. I listen to a lot of music, especially in my truck which has a custom sound system. My previous phone, the Google Pixel XL, had a headphone jack and outputs clean audio. When I connected my new OnePlus 9 Pro to my truck’s stereo using Bluetooth it sounded TERRIBLE. Bluetooth simply does not have good enough sound quality to substitute for a wired connection. OnePlus should put a quality DAC in their next phones and bring the jack back like Sony does with their Xperia series of phones. I refuse to be gaslit and told that a headphone jack isn’t viable on a water resistant phone; Samsung built water resistant phones with jacks for years and Sony still does. The inability to use wired headphones is also very annoying. I understand that USB-C to 3.5mm adapters exist but USB-C passthrough audio quality very rarely matches a direct 3.5mm connection (in fact, poor sound quality through USB-C passthrough audio and Bluetooth is one of the reasons I returned a previous OnePlus phone, the 8T). I’m going to force myself to live with it because I don’t have much of a choice (can’t find any suitable alternative phones with a jack that would work well on my network) but I’m very unhappy about it and will continue noting this as a complaint whenever possible. 
  
  Another thing I dislike about the phone is the ugly hole punch camera. I can at least praise OnePlus for putting it in the top left corner rather than the center of the display (corner hole punches are always going to be better than centered ones) but I still hate looking at it. The screen is vibrant and beautiful to look at but every time I see the ugly black dot for the camera I’m a little disgusted. This is coming from the same company that made the OnePlus 7 Pro, a phone with a full edge-to-edge display with no interruptions, notches, or hole punches. Hole punch cameras are such a downgrade from bezel-mounted cameras and pop up cameras. They are terrible. 
  
  OnePlus’ Visual Voicemail still doesn’t work on Mint Mobile (hasn’t since at least the OnePlus 7 Pro) which is very frustrating, especially considering I’ve seen OnePlus phones for sale on their website before! I would really appreciate if this could be addressed sometime. 
  
  The phone does come with some bloatware. You have the typical Google stuff which I can mostly give a pass, but then you have a few other weird software quirks like the inability to uninstall the Netflix app. Now personally I use Netflix, but what if I didn’t? I wouldn’t want an app on my phone I don’t use. This is the problem with bloatware, it takes choices away from the customer. All this being said, OnePlus does allow the phone’s bootloader to be unlocked to if you want to root the phone or flash a custom ROM, you can. I really appreciate that functionality as it has become very rare on US model Android smartphones. More and more manufacturers have decided to lock their phones down and disallow customer tinkering. Thank you, OnePlus, for being a part of the solution rather than the problem. 
  
  My last concern is software support. While OnePlus may be better than some Android manufacturers when it comes to updates and continued product support, in recent years they have been slacking off. Browse the OnePlus subreddit or the OnePlus community forum and you’ll see tons of complaints from customers with phones less than 3 years old who have no longer been receiving timely security or OS updates. While I can’t say how good software support will be for the OnePlus 9 Pro yet, it is something I’m a bit worried about. 
  
  Overall, I think this is a great device if slightly flawed. If you need a US 5G Android flagship, don’t hesitate. Buy the OnePlus 9 Pro.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1

I think you really need to see and hold these phones instead of just reading what the diagonal size is.

"I am very impressed with this phone. I came from an iphone SE 2020 after having a pixel 2 before that. I am one of those that prefers Android ( specifically pixel Android) over iOS. Although the SE was a good phone for the price there were some things that would irritate me over using the pixel. Things like notifications, the app drawer, call screening and spam blocking, the battery, and Google assistant vs siri were all things that made me switch back to the pixel line of phones. Also I am not in the apple ecosystem. I use majority of Google services and windows, although both play nice with the iPhone, the baked in features of Android with other Google products that use assistant is much nicer. 
  
  Things I like about this phone are the cameras, the battery life (very good! ), Bloat free Android, Google services and screen quality. 
  
  Things I wish I had are a 3 lens camera system, IP water resistance, wireless charging, and louder speakers ( although they don't sound bad). 
  
  Things I could care less about are really just the higher end processor. The Snapdragon 765 in this phone is more than fine. I may notice a slight delay in processing a photo or launch of an app but it's really a half second or a second nothing that is crazy in fact I notice similar delays in using the iPhone SE with the bionic 13 chip. Plus the battery savings is a great trade off in my opinion. Also I could care less about a high refresh screen and this screen is very nice too look at. 
  
  I know the things I wish it had could be had if I bought the pixel 5 but I think the price difference is too great for wireless charging and IP rating. If the pixel 5 was around $100 more I might have bit but I got this phone for $450 while the pixel 5 is $699. In my opinion it's not worth the difference when most of the experience will be practically identical. 
  
  TL/DR: buy this phone! It's a great buy, extremely smooth in use, great cameras, headphone jack, timely updates, great battery, good screen.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1

"I purchased a Pixel 4a 5G a couple of weeks ago. This was a big transition from a Galaxy S9, and the several other Galaxy devices prior. I was pretty excited to try a new phone. I went with an unlocked version instead of my cell carrier's. I was very happy with this decision. Getting all the apps and settings over from my S9 was complicated. Not the usual Samsung Switch process, so I invested lots of time setting it up. Here is what I liked about the Pixel 4a 5G:
  
  - The clean Android OS without all the carrier apps and Samsung apps. 
  - The phone ran smooth and fast enough for a non-gamer. 
  - The phone is light and a great size
  - The back mounted fingerprint reader was awesome. It runs circles around my Galaxy devices. 
  -Battery life was the best I've had in a long time. 
  
  The simplicity of the 4a 5G was nice, but maybe too simple in a couple ways, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, and returned my Pixel:
  
  - No gallery app built in. I did easily remedy this by finding a highly rated app that functioned well. 
  - The ring and notification volume controls are as one. This was a deal breaker for me. I could hear my ringtones, but I was missing all kinds of notifications. To hear my notifications, I had to turn up the volume too much and the ringtones were obnoxious. 
  - The screen was crisp but not nearly as bright as my older phones. I would have been ok with this difference. 
  
  I ended up returning the phone only because of the volume control issue. This may not be a problem for many people but there are plenty of reviews out here asking Google to fix this. I ended up with another S21 5G and I really wish the Pixel would have worked out...

"I'll confess that I typically buy budget phones. This is by far the most ""premium"" phone that I've ever owned. 
  
  So far, I'm very impressed by it. 
  
  Setup was an absolute breeze. The phone comes with a USB type-C to type-A adapter, and it guides you through hooking up your old phone to migrate everything over. With the exception of needing to log into a few apps, the transition was seamless. Even my custom wallpaper and ringtone carried over. 
  
  The camera quality is fantastic. The lens angle is a bit wider than I was expecting, but it's very user friendly. It's an absolute joy to use. 
  
  This latest version of android has NO navigation buttons at the bottom of the screen. I was managing well enough with this, but I was having an awful time trying to switch apps. The whole ""press the bottom of the screen (but not the middle or far right) + hold + swipe + hold"" to switch between apps is awful. Why they couldn't have just set it up as a 3-finger swipe up is beyond me. Fortunately, you can bring the buttons back by going into settings and searching for ""gestures."" Once I did that, things went much more smoothly. 
  
  The only other ""problem"" I've had with this phone is with its screen during calls. The screen automatically blacks out while you're in a call to prevent you from accidently dialing things with your face. This is generally a good thing. I find that the phone is slow to wake back up when you pull it away from your face though. I'll be ready to hang up the call, but it's a good couple seconds before the screen wakes up for me to do that. 
  
  This is more an annoyance than anything. 
  
  Call quality is phenomenal. Everything sounds great on my end, and I've received no complaints from the people that I talk to. 
  I live in an area with solid 5G coverage, and the data speeds are quite good as well.

"There are some great things I really like about the Google phone platform. Their phones have minimal to no bloatware, the phone is the first to receive android updates, the cameras have always taken great photos. They seem to have pivoted with their strategy. They are no longer trying to compete with high end pricey phones, they would rather make a real solid mid-tier level mobile. This is one of those devices. 
  
  As a heavy Gmail user this phone seamlessly works with everything google offers. The apps all sync wonderfully together. Mail syncs to my calendar, documents to the drive/cloud, and lots of other things that make a super smooth experience. Love that they included the fingerprint reader. It's always a faster unlock than facial recognition with zero fails. 
  
  Here's a strange issue I personally found. The screen doesn't get dark enough. For those bedtime moments when everyone uses their phone, the one's where all the lights are off and the phone is the only source of illumination, it just doesn't go low enough for my liking. But not a common issue for most people. Brightness isn't an issue, even in direct sunlight. Sound comes in loud and punchy. 
  
  The crowning jewel of the phone has to be the 5G ability. So much faster than 4G LTE. Downloaded a 2.5 Gb file from my Google drive, took well less than a minute to download. This device habitually tests at around 80- 100mbps speed in areas I got 5G coverage (see attached photo). Heck, I can hot spot my Chromebook and at times it's faster than my home internet. Battery life is pretty good to. A day of heavy use with hot spot and Bluetooth running, I still had 60sih percent battery left.

"I was a previously an owner of a Pixel 3a. After about the 30th drop within a year, the screen shattered. I bought a kit on Amazon and replaced it myself, but the adhesive was never the same, resulting in the replacement screen popping out every now and then. It was this and the limited 4gb of ram that ultimately let me to the upgrading to the Pixel 4a (5G). 
  
  I chose this model because of the faster processor and added wide-angle lens. The phone is just as you'd expect it to be. I love how Google has finally been able to create the iPhone equivalent on the Android platform. I knew I would get a great device with a great camera and everything would ""just work"". 
  
  I have not taken many photos with the 4a yet, however, I will say that for some reason, it just doesn't feel like Night Sight is as ""poppy"" sometimes lacking a little contrast and saturation that I came to expect from the 3a. 
  
  Also, coming from the smaller 3a to a 4a (5G), the screen is much larger, although the phone itself isn't far from the size of a 3a, thanks to the near non-existent bezels on the top and bottom. The larger screen is 100% more difficult to navigate with one hand, however.

"The Pixel 4a 5g is a nice step up from my Pixel 3a. Everyday performance has been smooth with scrolling and switching between apps. Just something so nice about vanilla android!

"If you are lucky enough to get a phone with no issues, then you may be really happy with the Pixel 4a 5G. The battery life alone was phenomenal. If you're a light user like me, this really should have been a 5 star phone. I was not so lucky. 
  
  I had the misfortune of getting a phone that had audio problems (static noise on every phone call) right out of the box. A few months later, it developed more severe problems where the phone would restart randomly during calls. 
  
  Now, normally, this would not be enough to warrant a one star review. But Google's technical support process was, well, comically bad. How bad? Negative 10 stars bad. 
  
  Without getting too far into the details, after four months of back-and-forth with Google Support emails and chats, we did not reach a satisfactory conclusion and I basically gave up. 
  
  Their support process was an absolute nightmare and feels like it was DESIGNED to waste your time. They escalated through 4 or 5 levels of support managers, always apologizing, but never really addressing the questions or issues raised. They usually just copy-pasted the same replies and said ""this is our policy"". 
  
  RMAs are usually no big deal. But Google sent me on a fool's errand involving factory resets, Safe Mode experiments, visiting a local repair shop (that didn't stock the right the parts), going back to Best Buy, and then, and then, and then... Felt like I had a full time job trying to get this darn phone fixed or replaced. 
  
  Just know going in that if anything goes wrong with your phone outside of the Best Buy return window, Google can make it VERY HARD to solve the problem and is more focused on their own policies than on customer satisfaction. The only thing that got their attention was to post on Twitter, and then they eventually escalated the case and provided some RMA options for a refurbished replacement. 
  
  It's kind of a shame. I wanted to like this phone, but the terrible customer service experience really put me off of Google hardware, probably for awhile.",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1

Love this phone. Camera is really nice. Kinda having issues with At&t network connecting to 5G since it is an unlocked version. Went to At&t store and they said this is a common problem.

"The Google Pixel 4a 5G falls in between the Pixel 4a and Pixel 5 in terms of features. If you don’t need all the bells and whistles of the Pixel 5, you can save some money with the 4a 5G. At the same time, it’s worth paying extra for the 4a 5G over the 4a. As the name implies, 5G capability is the most obvious upgrade over the 4a, but the real value is the excellent camera. It’s the same camera hardware and software that’s in the flagship Pixel 5. 
  
  PROs
  • 2 cameras on the back plus 1 in front. It’s the same Pixel camera hardware and software as the flagship Pixel 5. Photos are excellent though a bit undersaturated and with less dynamic range than my iPhone 11 Pro (I know, unfair comparison). 
  • Headphone port which is great because my earbuds aren’t always charged and ready to go
  • Large 6.2” screen yet doesn’t feel heavy
  • Decent speaker sound for a phone
  • Fingerprint sensor on the back
  • 128 GB storage is standard 
  • 3 years worth of Android updates directly from Google
  • Good price for the feature set
  
  CONs
  • No wireless charging
  • No SD card slot for adding storage space
  • Not water or dust resistant
  • 60Hz refresh makes the display not as smooth as the 90Hz on the Pixel 5 (or 120Hz on higher end phones of other brands). This is noticeably mostly in action games. For general texting, email, web surfing, etc… you won’t notice it. 
  
  Since 5G is still in early rollouts and not available everywhere, the standout feature here is the camera. For most people, a general purpose phone with a good camera is all they really need. And the Pixel 4a 5G delivers on that.",1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

"The Pixel 4a5g is the best of the new Google Pixel devices. While it may cost $150 more than the regular 4a, the amount of added features can't be understated. It has a battery of 3800 mah over the pixel 4a's 3085 (It might be 3185). Furthermore, this phone has the same processor as the $700 pixel 5: The snapdragon 765g. The chipset is complemented perfectly by the larger battery, so the higher consumption is negligible. Furthermore, its screen is significantly bigger than the 4a, and the main reason why I chose this device. While it may have larger bezzels than its 700 dollar counterpart, the 4a5g has a larger screen than the 5. Additionally, it has the same camera system as the 5, including the ultrawide which the 4a is missing. 
  
  Now that the differences are out of the way, the 4a5g as a standalone device is amazing. It has excellent battery life, a clear 1080p OLED display, a clean software experience, great integration with google services, and the best camera on a phone for its price. Google's image software can turn mediocre hardware into titan-levels of incredible. 
  The headphone jack and rear fingerprint scanner are the cherries on top.

"The Google Pixel 4a 5G is the next step up from the standard 4a and older 3a, with this model offering 5G (where available) and a slightly larger OLED screen at 6.2 inches (at 1080p resolution). With 128 gigs of storage (no card slot for more, though), 6 gigs of RAM, and a new Snapdragon 765G processor, you will see a bump in speed over the previous Pixel 3a for sure. While considered a mid-range processor and while the screen is 60hz in a time where many phone are updating to 90 or 120 hz screens, I still find everything to flow smoothly when using this new model. The OLED screen is very nice, showing true blacks and good viewing angles, with a noticeable bump in brightness over the Pixel 3a before it. Sound has received a boost as well with stereo speakers being louder than the previous model – a very welcome update. Charging is via USB-C but unfortunately, there is no wireless charging on this model (Boo). 
  
  There are now two cameras on the back of the Pixel 4a 5G – one is the standard 12.2 megapixel variant which is still excellent but hasn’t changed much in the last couple of versions of the Pixel series. A 16 megapixel extra-wide camera is now also on back, so you can get more into your photos as needed. HDR, high dynamic range, where you see more details in darker and lighter areas, has always been a strength in the Pixel line, and is just as excellent in these cameras, as well as the amount of detail captured in the photos. Details appear in the shadows without blown-out bright areas in most photos, which not all phone cameras are good at. The 8 megapixel front facing camera (now in the upper-corner of the front) is also very good, though not quite as wide angle as some may like. Portrait modes are available on the cameras. Again, while they haven’t evolved much, they haven’t really had to – they are still really, really, good cameras. Software offers Panoramic shots (which unfortunately I found only average, not showing as much detail as standard shots, a photo sphere feature, and Google Lens (to ID objects, etc). The built-in flash does a decent job when needed. 
  
  Movies can be taken in 1080p or 4K at 30 or 60 frames per second. Slower motion features offer faster frames in 1080p. While the still photo capability of the Pixel phones has been the or among the best of all smart phones for the last few years, I’m not quite as pleased with the video quality. It’s “ok”, but many times lacks details, and when zooming even a small amount, can get very pixelated very quick. Again, NOT the case with the still shots. If photos are your thing, this is a phone to strongly consider. If video is your top priority, there may be better options available. 
  
  I tested The 4a 5G out using Good Fi’s cell service. Call quality was good – the speaker and microphones had no problem allowing me to hear others clearly, and for them to hear me clearly as well. The 5G antenna kicked in when it detected service in the area(s) I was in, but even now it’s still hit-or-miss. The best 5G speed I clocked was at 103mbs download and only just above 12mbs upload – and those speeds varied greatly depending on whether I was inside, outside, what room I was in, or if I was near larger objects. So while 5G services in general have a way to go, the antennas in the phone itself for 5G as well as WiFi seemed to be strong and do just fine. 
  
  I can only find two things to gripe about on this phone: First, the fingerprint reader on the back is flush with the body, and sits near the camera module; it’s VERY hard to “feel” with your finger, much more so than the 3a was. I strongly suggest getting a case that has a raised area around the reader button so it help guide your finger to it (and provides extra grip). The second complaint is battery life; the 3885 mAh battery charges quick enough with the 18 watt charger that comes with the phone, but it drains pretty quickly – I dare say, it seems at least, to drain even more quickly than the 3a, which wasn’t great on it’s own. If you are a light to medium user, you can get through a standard work day with this, but if your use falls into the high-medium to high use category, you may want to have a battery bank, or chargers around to top off as the day progresses. Things may improve slightly as the battery conditions itself with multiple chargings, or if you turn off the always-on part of the display which shows you your time and notification icons (but that’s part of the convenience of this phone – having that on). 
  
  Phone makers are pushing the boundaries of price these days with some niche phones reaching close to the $2,000 mark (!!) and the average flagship phone being at or close to $1,000.00. So to find something with all of the features of the 4a 5G for an average price of $499 (often on sale further) is wonderful. For most people, I personally think this phone would be all they need so long as you do not have a very specific need for a very long-life battery or must have the very top processor for special games or apps that need it. Pixels get updates before all other Androids, and again, the camera (for photos) is still extremely hard to beat. Recommended.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1

  I would highly recommend this phone for anyone who is looking for the best value for what they pay. The phones that cost less than this one generally are of much lower quality, while there are iPhone's and Galaxy's that may beat this in certain specs they don't beat it by enough to justify their much higher price tags. This is the best phone you are likely to find for under $500, and I highly recommend it for anyone who is looking for a premium phone that offers a far better value than other premium phones.",1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

"The Pixel 4a 5G is the latest iteration of the ""lite"" version of its flagship phone, though I find it difficult finding what makes it the lesser product. There are features that the 4a 5G has that I would have gladly paid more for over the Pixel 5, like the headphone jack and slightly larger 6.2"" screen, though the wireless charging (and reverse wireless charging) features didn't make the cut. 
  
  Coming from a Pixel 3, the larger phone is obviously heavier, and the huge camera panel in the back practically begs for a case as the camera does not sit flush with the back panel. A larger screen means that reaching for the edges of the screen, where most of the UI elements that my thumbs are used to, now sit just out of reach, requiring a slight hand adjustment every time. That might be why the stock UI default is the gesture style instead of the old three button. Not being a fan of the gesture style since it is one extra movement to use the back button (as well as swiping in from the left already being a gesture for many apps that I already use), I changed back to the three button mode post haste. 
  
  The centerpiece of the phone has got to be the camera. Double-tapping the power button brings up the camera in an instant. Zero shutter lag means you capture the exact image you intend. This 5G version of the 4a also borrows the ultrawide angle lens found in the Pixel 5, something the regular 4a lacks. The ultrawide lens lets you capture more of a scene, but also gives subjects that distorted funhouse mirror look. 
  
  I think that the best thing about this phone is just how unremarkable it is. While that may sound bad, it's honestly refreshing to have a phone behave the way you expect with nothing extra. Apps start up quickly, security updates come regularly directly from Google. Unless you really need the waterproofing and wireless charging, or some kind of gimmick like a folding screen or a pen, this is the phone to get. So long as you are using a provider that offers it in a supported location, the 5G download speeds are blazing fast. In my area I was pulling down 185 Mbps using the Speedtest app, and 200 Mbps according to Netflix's FAST app. 
  
  I received the fabric case to review, and while it does the job of protecting the back of the phone, especially the protruding camera, I find it too scratchy to use.",1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1

"This is going to be a rough one. As a company, OnePlus has been built on offering fantastic, flagship performing smartphones for many years. This phone was a massive mis-step for them, regardless of the price. Let's dive in:
  
  Screen: After taking the phone out of the box and using it for awhile, the first thing that confused me was OnePlus' decision on display tech. While an LCD display in this price category isn't unusual, the choice to have it at only 720p HD vs 1080p on similar phones in this price segment (Moto G) was confusing. Moreover, it's also a 90hz refresh rate display. This would usually mean the phone would feel silky smooth while using it, but not in this case. This is likely due to the processor choice OnePlus made here, which brings us to our next point. 
  
  Processor: This phone is equipped with a Snapdragon 460 chipset. In real-world terms, this is the bottom of the barrel as far as performance goes. I don't understand why OnePlus didn't at least opt for a Snapdragon 660 for this one. This would have made a WORLD of difference. Even with the 90hz display on this phone, it CRAWLS. It's extremely disappointing and unbecoming of OnePlus and deals a blow to their brand image. Even casual users that don't game or anything will notice this lag. 
  
  Cameras: They're there, they're passable, but that's it. Don't expect any nice shots out of these. 
  
  All in all, as I said earlier, the fact that this phone exists is very confusing to me.

"I decided to take a chance and get this phone. I've been a loyal Android fan for as long as I can remember, but it seems that so many people have and love their iPhones. So, I thought I'd give it a try. Here are my findings:
  
  1) This design is worse than the Pixel 3 with the chin and forehead. They really should have spent some money updating the design. 
  
  2) The camera is poor at night or in dark shots. I'm pretty confident it is merely a software thing and Apple could easily update it, so it is frustrating that it would not be available at launch. I did install Neural Night Cam and that helped a lot. 
  
  3) TouchID - it's not even remotely the same as on an Android with a fingerprint reader. I did not like how it functioned as the back button or that you had to hard press it. Maybe some people do, but it just wasn't for me. I prefer gestures. 
  
  4) iOS - lacks so much ability to customize as you can with Android. This is probably the major reason I returned the phone. It is just not the same experience, despite what skin you use with Android.",1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1

"Upgraded from a 1.25 year old mid-range phone and so far so good. Certain web-sites that play videos now run noticeably faster and smoother, so the 6 GB of RAM and CPU is worth the premium. Camera image quality is also very good, clear, and responsive. Even though there is only one visible speaker vent/grill, the audio output from earphone and speaker are excellent. Android 10 sucks - formatting microSD as internal memory is not available, but the phone has 128 GB so it's not a deal breaker and you'll need to be somewhat current on Android otherwise you run the risk of app compatibility. Screen is .02"" larger than previous phone I had, so no major change for me here, though the screen is taller and narrower and AMOLED is brightness range is slightly higher. Plastic shell instead of aluminum or tin feels cheap, but the phone has weight to make it feel substantial. The black dot for the camera in the screen is very goofy, but it's the trend.

  The camera works great and has more features than my old phone. Pictures have been crisp and clear.

The phone is cool but there have been a few problems with it. I had a hard time getting it hooked up and after 2 trips to both best buy and sprint it was finally hooked THEN i was told it wasnot 5g compatable! After going on for hours( literally) about how excited i was to be getting 5g. After all the time it took i just said screw it and took it home. Also they said i had to change my plan. It was slow as hell so i had to call and get my old plan back and its still slower than my old phone was. THEN after i had it for 17 days it stopped making and recieving calls and i spent ANOTHER hour and a half on the phone with sprint. They couldnt fix it and said a specialest would call me within 3 days. I was using messenger to call then it started working again 2 days later. Idk if i should return it now or what. Worried it will happen again after its too long to exchange. Its a cool phone. When it works tho!,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1

  The lack of a power button is also a bummer. What would be a power button is the bixby button, lame. I don't like this as I like the convenience of being able to power of my phone with a physical button.

Why they don't advertise this kind of phone makes no sense. Love having 2 screens but at the same time you can take out the phone from the dual screen case and just use it alone if you want. Or you can fold it back and keep it in the case and use only 1 screen. It is easy to use and it is great to be able to do one thing on one screen and something completely differently on the other.

"Overall I think this phone is a good deal if you can get it on sale like I did. In general I think samsung has chosen the right hardware points to compromise on, but I find Samsung's approach to android extremely frustrating. 
  
  I bought this phone as an upgrade to my 3 year old OnePlus 5t. I think this phone is in a similar place in the market as that phone when it was new. I like the hardware of this phone. It seems to have all the useful features (wireless charging, water resistance, sd card) with none of the gimmicks. The notable exceptions are the battery life and and the lack of 3.5mm headphone jack. Reviews I read led me to believe that this phone would have above average battery life with over a day on the tank. In reality I find it much worse than my old phone. I can just squeak out one day with the phone typically under 10% at the end. The 5t would easily go 2 days. I use the phone a lot during the day for streaming music, podcasts, and/or audio books to bluetooth earbuds. On top of the mediocre battery life, the phone is much slower to charge than my old OnePlus 5t and the included power brick is not even the fastest charging one for the phone. You have to buy that separately, lol. The one other hardware(?) Related gripe I have is that this phone has no ability to turn itself on for an alarm. The 5t could wake itself for the alarm, this phone cannot. So if you plan to use it as an alarm, you will need to leave it on all night. Otherwise the hardware is great and I am happy with it. The expandable storage is a nice touch. 
  
  My main gripe is with Samsung's take on android. This is my first samsung phone and I find One UI buggy and frustrating. Samsung really wants you to use their ecosystem but it seems like it offers realtively few actually useful features. A lot of the features seemed geared towards allowing you to interact with other people with samsung phones. This approach works with apple because iPhones are ubiquitous enough, but literally none of my friends have samsung phones so most of these features are useless wastes of space to me. Samsung does allow you to uninstall some of the apps that come with the phone, but not enough in my opinion. Some of the default samsung apps have ads in them which feels extremely cheap when you have already bought a premium device from the company. 
  
  What's really frustrating is how hard they make it for you to opt out of the samsung ecosystem. For example, I use the microsoft launcher, but every time I reboot the phone it changes the default launcher app back to Samsung's One UI. I have to go into settings to change it back and then also wipe the cache and storage for the one UI app to get the phone to use the microsoft launcher again (a bit strange for a company that does a lot of partnerships with microsoft). Additionally, I use the Google messages app for texting, but the phone app/combo has difficulting downloading MMSs that were sent while the phone was disconnected (airplane mode or off). I have to switch the default messaging app back to the samsung one, download the MMS to read it, and then change back to the messaging app I prefer. As a final example, a long press of the power button by default launches bixby, Samsung's personal assistant. If you change your personal assistant app (to, say, google) the power button still launches bixby. You can change the power button to instead bring up the power menu, but there is no way to have it bring up the personal assistant of your choice. Seriously? All of this seems like manipulative and coercive attempts to get you to use their apps so thay they can profit off you via ad revenue. It's against the spirit of android. If I had wanted to be forced into an ecosystem I would have bought an iphone; they do a better job with that if only because the have a larger market share. 
  
  There are some software features that are nice touches though. The link to windows feature is cool and useful, allowing you to pull up apps from your phone on your windows 10 pc. Samsung Dex seems like some cool innovation and I like the idea of it, though at the moment I don't really have a use case for it. 
  
  So overall my advice is: if you have already owned galaxy phones and like Samsung's software, this phone is a great deal for you. Otherwise I would advise a purer android experience like a pixel phone or a OnePlus. If you want an ecosystem but haven't bought into samsung yet, get an iPhone.",0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

"Waited a month to review as this phone is my daily driver. I have been a sucker for smaller firm factor phones as carrying a tablet makes no sense to me. This phone is crazy fast, great camera, waterproof and has wireless charging. Software is as you expect simply the best for a mobile device.

"This is a stand alone phone that snaps into a case with a second screen. You can switch between screens. So you can play a game like Pokemon go while watching Netflix. You can play other games that you may prefere a controller. Put the game on one screen and the controller on the other. When the phone is in the case it comes with a magnetic charging end to hook to your usbC cable. If the phone is out of the case you can use usbC. Specs are good, screen is good. For the price its a great phone. 
  
  Negatives: Slippery. If in the case for dual screen and folded over to use single screen you have one screen down on desk or pant leg. It will fall. No matter what way you use it, its slippery.

"While overall this is a very nice phone, and I especially love the display and some of the other features, I just come to the conclusion, before I return this thing, that is just not worth the money. 
  
  In the first place the dual screen display is for all practical purposes useless - a gimmick. The mere fact of being able to look at two different screens while running two different apps is not necessary at all except in the most extreme situations. It really doesn't do what it claims it does even when sliding one app from the main screen over to the second screen - in most cases it doesn't work! The battery life is not good either especially if you use the dual screen a lot. 
  
  What I also found out was that shortly after I bought it LG released the upgrade to android 10, which totally wiped out the dual screen feature. It was later on in the day a second firmware update was released to correct the dual screen issue and which also removed a couple of the default dual screen apps! When I called LG support, apparently they weren't even aware of this and told me to just reset the phone! 
  
  The other very annoying thing is, not being able to find another case for the phone. The dual screen does come with a case to mount the main unit into, but it's not a very good case. The outside or third screen and the camera area which is very exposed for some reason, are very susceptible to being scratched or damaged in any situation of being dropped! The outside vendor screen protectors do not work! 
  
  I've noticed in many reviews people loved this phone, and frankly I'd like it too, but there's just too many things that can go wrong, while not having a lot of things that go right! I thought getting this phone would allow me to go on Facebook for example, look at the image or video of what I was responding to, and being able to type it in on the other screen. In reality that is not what happens and even if there is an app to do that, how much work would it be to get it to work. 
  
  The concept of this phone is wonderful, it just needs to be more refined, and more standard. 
  
  The other problem is when using the dual screen, the magnetic connector that connects the USB – C cord, is a totally bad idea, and does not allow this when the dual screen is mounted to use a USB- C adapter to connect anything else such as a separate hard drive, although it will allow you to connect to a computer. 
  
  Overall for me, the phone is impractical. I do not carry my phone in my hand as many do nor do I carry my phone in my butt pocket as many do. The third screen is going to get scratched! If you carry it in a holster is too much trouble to keep pulling it out thereby increasing the chances of it being dropped! Because it is a dual screen apparently nobody is going to make a holster on which to carry it. And although you can fold the dual screen back 180° against the main phone, now you make that dual screen susceptible to being damaged or scratched! 
  
  Just not practical!",1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1

"I bought this phone about 3 months ago. Overall its a cool phone, especially with the duel screen. There are just a few issues I am having with it. For example, the keyboard dissappears while I'm typing sometimes. It just happened 2 times while typing this sentence. Another thing is that there isna dead pixel on the top left of my screen. Its not that big of a deal because its hard notice it but you still notice it if you pay close attention. Im sure if I contact LG they would replace my phone with their manufacturers warranty, I just havent gotten around that. But aside from these issues this phone is awesome. The battery lasts 8+ hours with youtube running the entire time.

"I have this phone since the beginning of last December. It is a perfect phone for me as I like multitasking, reading chats when reading news, looking up google map for spots while google for facts. It was unbelievably cheap and reliable when compared with the other fold phones. It is fast no doubt but the screen is the single factor that was a 'love at first sight'! There are minor issues which I get used to: charging using the magnetic dongle-type adapter (but I can just throw and it sticks in the dark) , holding a heavier phone (but you can't complain when you have dual), flipping to get the main camera (but you get a perfect stand for self-fie), etc.
  Another plus side is that my wife like the dual screen to see what she would look like before I snap the pictures on the other screen /side. 
  The battery life is good as I have never ran out of juice for a day's use. It has enormous space to store and it even can have an expansion slot for micro SD (up to 1tB).

"As much as I live the performance and easy upgrade setup, I am disappointed in the lack of features and accessories included with this latest version of the Galaxy S series. First, I had not realized that Samsung did away with the SD card option. Had I realized this I would have gone for the S20. My other disappointment is the lack of included accessories. This phone is for my wife since I just bought the S20 last year. My phone came with a headset, charging block and USB wire. The S21 only included a short USB-C wire. It seems to me that either Samsung is getting cheap or they're trying to emulate Apple's cost-cutting measures. In either case, I wish they would stop following Apple. If I liked Apple products I would have bought an iPhone instead of a Galaxy.

I like this phone. The phone itself works well and the dual screen is the added bonus that tipped it over the scales for me. The foldable screen makes a great stand while watching vids. Good speaker and microphone. The front display is really nothing more than the clock. Great battery power. The phone is no bigger than the Samsung line and only slightly heavier with the dual case but you do need to open the case to answer the call. The speakerphone is a problem as others have stated; when on it lasts about a minute then drops the call. The voice recognition is great as is the spell assist; however it does not have the word-ahead prediction like Samsung which is a feature I do miss. You must type every word since it does not offer the next logical word in you sentence.

"I hate large phones. I felt the previous SE, at 4.87in tall, was the PERFECT size for my hands, one-handed browsing, pocket real estate, and several other benefits. So imagine my dismay when Apple announced the next SE was going with the 7/8 size. My old SE started getting slow and I was looking into other non-Apple, similarly sized alternatives. But hearing that this had the same guts as the top of the line XI, and it still had the physical button and absence of the ""notch"" (no offense to fans of that style, it's just not for ME), at a price point of $399, for 64GB MINIMUM, well, I dove in. Not disappointed so far. Blazing fast, razor sharp, easy to hold. The adjustment to the larger dimension was not as much as I'd feared, and the VALUE.

"I have been a samsung person since day one. Everything i own is samsung. I saw this LG phone and HAD to have it. So this is my review of this phone, ive owned it for aobut 2 days now. 
  
  Pros:
  Really fast phone, everything seems to open and run quickly, i had a galaxy s8+, so this seems much faster. 
  The dual screen is amazing, love that i can do 2 things at once, very helpful & quality is nice. 
  The wallpapers for the dual screen are nice. 
  Videos look great, watched a couple of them, love that i can switch from screen to screen. 
  Memory is good, but you end up with about 96 gigs after all the installs. Thankfully you can add i believe up to 2tb in a memory card. 
  Calls are clear and crisp. 
  The bulky and feel of it isnt at bad as some reviewers say. 
  Battery life is amazing
  Sound is amazing!!!!! 
  
  Cons:
  Its a different android, u cant swipe up for apps. All the apps are on the main screen, took awhile to figure out how to hide them all and only have my apps. 
  No screen protectors for the front of the dual screen case, u can see fingerprints really good and needs to wipe off often. Bought a universal protector to put on it. 
  Fm radio is good, but you need to take phone out of case for headphones to go into phone directly unless you buy an adapter. 
  Limited wallpaper for dual screens and no live wallpapers, assuming this will change. 
  Found a couple wallpapers, but have to use paypal to purchase instead of adding credit card. Hoping this will change in time as well. 
  Screen is deff 1080p, not 4k unfortunally. Screens and videos look nice, but not as vibrant as a 4k screen, ive noticed such as on pokemon go, colors sometimes seem washed and not as whoa as they were on the samsung screen. 
  
  Over all, very happy with this phone. It seems good and solid, the hinge on the case is sturdy and good for leveling out for pics and videos. Its cheaper then the single screen foldable phones which is also a + in my book. I got it for 699 unlocked, works with no issues with my carrier. So for the price and quality, deff worth getting. 4 stars is only cause the android not being as user friendly as with other phones. You have to go into settings to ""hide"" the apps from the main screen you dont like instead of just clicking, then hitting remove.",0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

"Here are my first impressions after having the phone for three days. 
  
  Pros
  - Nice camera. It's not professional grade, but for the average consumer, it's great. 
  - Widgets! This is my first time using a android device, and I still have a lot to learn about the OS, but so far I've really enjoyed being able to customize the screen with various widgets. 
  
  Cons
  -The finger print reader could be better. It requires a second scan about 1/3 of the time
  -Not a quality speaker for music. This isn't a problem if you plan on listening to music with your headphones, (Bluetooth, as there is no audio jack), but if you like to Jam with your friends you should get a separate Bluetooth speaker. 
  -Too big for hands and pockets. 
  
  Additional Notes
  - Bixby vs Google Assistant. Similar to Siri, Bixby and Google Assistant allow you to search things and access various phone features by voice, such as adding an event to your google calendar in a single sentence. However, they work in very different ways and having two options is confusing. 
  
  Bixby is optimized to work with Samsung/Microsoft features, and will only work with pre-made 'capsules', like Netflix or Spotify. For example, if I say 'Play the Duck Tales theme song', Bixby asks me to add a Spotify account and will not play my music from YouTube Music or Apple Music. 
  
  Google Assistant operates more like Google. It has better search functions and will play music from any app I ask. However, Google Assistant and Bixby have different apps for their reminders, and when I add a reminder using Google Assistant it does not add it to the Samsung 'Reminders' widgets. 
  
  It is nice to have options, but it feels like Samsung, Microsoft, and Google are all fighting for your attention on the same device.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

I've had this phone for almost a week and I think it is a really well made phone. For the price it's hard to beat. The screen is vivid and beautiful. The processor is superfast and the camera takes awesome pics. The camera app has so many functions I don't think I'll ever use them. The face unlock feature along with fingerprint unlock work quickly and reliably. The 5G works fine on Tmobile. Speeds can vary tremendously depending on what the carrier's coverage is. I wish it had a 3.5mm headphone jack but this is still a great phone. I highly recommend it.,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

"This review is just my opinion on what I experienced while I was using this Samsung S20 FE 5g phone, I'm not a License Professional nor a Tech person just a consumer. What I like about Samsung S20 FE 5g are the features of the phone it was fast, & it has expandable memory like microSD slot, NFC, water resistance (as long as you don't dip it in a pool for a long time lol! ), For internet connections it has a Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac/ax 2.4g+5ghz Awesome! , Bluetooth, and for the Camera this one has a rear Triple Camera 12MP Ultra Wide (back) while in a (Front) for Selfie ones it has 32MP Camera perfect for taking pictures and use it in a mini photo box studio. When you open any Applications & scroll it… You'll see how smooth & fast if you try one. For a display screen, I was amazed how clear it was for watching a video in a 6.5-inch 6 Infinity-O Super AMOLED display screen with a super smooth 120Hz. 
  The only thing that I don' t like is that this model does not have a dual sim for the price that I paid. I know all phones are very expensive but for the phone that is a hefty price they should have put that features as well. 
  If you're looking for a dual sim make sure to double-check at the store first if they carry one. I was looking for a dual SIM, but unfortunately I have no other choice back then because they only have 1 phone available in their store. I'm not sure if all best buy carry a single sim model only since mine that I bought from the store was just a single sim model. Double check to the store if you need a dual sim instead because not all models has a double SIM card or a Hybrid SIM Slot, I'm sure some of them carry those double sim card model.",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

"My old phone was an iPhone 6s and by the generation, you can tell I was in the need of a new phone. I contemplated the pixel 4a between the iPhone SE because I am on a budget and did not desire high specs. Long story short the Pixel 4a was back-ordered and canceled so I did more searching and discovered the Galaxy FE. It has an attractive price with the specs of a flagship phone. After researching other phones I knew it was worth it to shovel out an extra $200 to get this phone. Not to mention, it is already on sale for $150 off! This is my first android phone and here are my first impressions:
  
  1. Extremely customizable, make it functional to your liking. One of my favorite features is reducing the screen size to reach all buttons with one hand. 
  2. The screen is big, which makes watching videos and playing games more immersive and enjoyable. 
  3. The picture quality is amazing. You have various modes to capture the right picture. The night mode is especially good. It does a good job and brightening dark areas without over saturating. 
  4. The OLED screen is crisp. Also, the 120Hz refresh rate makes navigating through the phone smooth and seamless. 
  5. The sound quality is surprisingly good. It has Dolby Atmos, which boosts sound quality and clarity.

"Great price at 399$, at the beginning battery life and charging speed were terrible, almost to the point of wanting to return the phone, but I figured out that if you used the medium battery saving profile and use a quick charge 4.0 21w+ charging brick, both issues were solved and even with the dual screen on, battery life is great. 
  The dual screen usual an adapter that can get lost and does not give the max 21w, can be easily lost and disconnected, aswell as being difficult to find a replacement and expensive, but acceptable. 
  and the dual screen case is very fragile, aswell as glass screen protectors for it are very rare and expensive, ended up buying about 50$ worth of screen protectors because of this+8$ for the charging adapter. 
  Wide view mode is very appropriated, and can be unlocked to all apps through a third party app, which makes it much more worth it. 
  I enabled Tablet mode since I felt it works well with the dual screen by changing the DPI in dev options to 720. 
  All in All, owning the phone went from hating it, to liking it, to loving it. 
  My second option was the Samsung S10 lite, but it was 50$ more expensive on sale and after missing the sale went up alot, I wanted it for the 45W charging and better software, but in the end, I didnt feel I lost much since I loved the dual screen, also I bought it since verizon doesn't allow chinese phones, these would be my perfered, but for what I can get, this was good, last phone was a Razer Phone 2 for the same verizon reason, and that didn't turn out well at all with reliability, lets hope this one will last, I owned a LG G2, G5 and G7, had issues with all but the G7, but loved them very much.

"I've been using Apple since the Mac Quadra and use iMacs every day so you'd think the iphone was a good fit: WRONG. I tried iphones 7 years ago and ending up smashing mine in frustration. Today, I first tried an iphone 6 but upgraded to the SE in the hopes I'd understand why everyone was so enthusiastic about iphones. The SE is SO SMALL only an infant could use the screen imo. It also wouldn't screen cast my applications so I had to buy a $50 HDMI to lightning adapter. I tried to upgrade to an iphone 12 and can'd do it on pre-paid. 
  
  I returned the SE, paid the $45 restocking fee, and bought a $150 Samsung. IMMEDIATELY it screen casted and the massive screen would have cost $1099 IF it were even available on the iphone. 
  
  WHY WHY WHY do people pay so much for Apple when they have an inferior operating system? I don't really CARE that the 12 has the ""fastest processor ever"" -- I do everything important on iMacs, not my phone! MUST BE A SOCIAL THING that I'm not privy to. I'll never understand why people are willing to fork over five hundred or a thousand dollars for a phone you can't even expand the memory in.

"At $600 the Galaxy S20 FE 5G is too much of a good deal to pass up. Sure, there are several very good mid-tier devices out there today, but for $600 you are getting a brand-new device that performs better (in almost any area) than many year-old flagships that used to cost more than $900. Here's what I can tell you based on my last 48 hours playing with the phone: 1. The cameras are outstanding (day or night), even when compared to state-of-the-art phones from less than a year ago. 2. The phone supports 5G, which works quite well with my current provider. 3. The screen, which is flat and great for screen protectors, is also flagship quality (120 Hz refresh rate) 4. The battery is great. 5. The phone has a top-of-the line processor. 
  
  OK, the S20 FE lacks a 3.5 mm audio jack; however, I can trade that for the ability to expand the phone's memory via a micro-SD card. 
  
  Again, there are so many good things packaged in this device that I'm happy it exists at this price point. In my opinion, and from an entirely pragmatic / techie point of view, the Galaxy S20 FE 5G is one of the best deals I've seen in a while.

"I've been using this phone for two months now and I've got to say that I really enjoy it. The dual screen functions work seamlessly together, and especially for the price that you pay, you really do get a great quality phone. The battery life is actually not that bad. I can go a full day of using it regularly without having to get a charge in until I go to bed. Trying to use the phone with one hand is definitely going to be a challenge so if that is you then this is not the phone for you. It is quite bulky so, although it does go into your pocket, it is definitely going bulge out quite a bit. 
  
  I often remove it from the dual screen case to use as a single screen phone for when I'm driving to attach it to a mount. This doesn't seem to affect the connectivity between the case and the phone over time. It's only been two months, but based on the quality of the build, I don't see it being an issue further down the line either. 
  
  Two things that I didn't like. One, there aren't any tempered glass screen protectors out there that fit the phone and the dual screen case. There are a lot of glass parts that are exposed very often. So I don't trust a normal film screen protector. So it's a shame that I can't get a tempered glass protector for every screen, especially the outside front screen and the ridiculously large cut out for the camera and the logo on the back. I imagine it was made this way to show the logo, but I think that was a huge oversight on LG's part. 
  
  Two, they provide a magsafe dongle to be able to connect a charging cable to your phone while it is still in the dualscreen case. It's nice that it was included, but it doesn't stay connected very well. You've got to leave the phone down and the cable with enough slack so that it doesn't fall off the phone. Didn't seem to take too much tension to snap it off the phone. Luckily, I had a wireless charger so I stopped using the dongle and use the wireless charger now. The wireless charging works through the dualscreen case, so that is a plus. 
  
  All in all, I really love the phone and don't regret switching over from a larger brand name flagship phone.",1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"I think the product was good. My primary purpose with the device was to find a device that was not outdated, but up to date; and sleek, with easy user-ability. LG difinately hit the mark on that one. As far as OS goes they kept it simple enough, and classic with a twist on modern technology to 2019 standards, the triple screen case that was included. As far as drop testing the device, I did notice a little bit of a flaw. After the first attempt, and only attempt for that matter, it seemed like weight was a bit of an issue. The impact at 6 feet was to much for it. Opon normal, active standards, 6 feet probably isn't the best approach, but in my eyes, I want a device that can pack a mean punch on ram, and look amazing; but still deliver what's needed, if under intense situations. That's why I rated this device at a 4 instead of a five. The price was comparisingly good, and ram seemed like it fit the description. It was the perfect device for my fiancee, as her device speed standards differ from my own. She does forget to close out applications, and isn't aware of processes that run in the background, or how to stop or foreclose them. 
  Over all, LG did great in my book, and eyes; and gets my honest opinion from here on out!

"In terms of the processor power and ram, this phone is near the top of the line. For my purposes, it is very quick and responsive. Colors are vibrant, and resolution is good. The size is similar to my old LG V20, and with the dual screen case the thickness is only slightly greater. It is noticeably heavier but still not bad. The optional dual screen is what makes this phone unique, and I'm still adapting to its uses. I'm not much of a multitasker which the dual screen in designed for, but perhaps I will learn to use the second screen in the near future. The price is way more than what I would want to pay for a phone, but YOLO. Probably not a bad value for 2 screens. The bifold design makes it easy to stand up for taking selfies, video chatting, etc. Cameras are fair, and the selfie camera is much better than my old phone. I like that it has wireless charging. The published specs said it came with Android 9.0, but to my pleasant surprise it came with 10.0 and a recent security patch. I popped in my Straighttalk (Verizon towers) SIM card from my old phone, and it was a seamless transition. I didn't even have to mess with APN settings this time. Transferring data like text messages from the old phone is always a hassle, but with the right apps, I got it done. Of course, I love that it accepts a microsd card to expand the memory. 
  
  As for its disadvantages, I suppose it is quite awkward to hold the phone with one hand and swipe with the thumb of the same hand that many people are accustomed to. It definitely requires 2 hands to use. The in-screen finger print reader, as others have mentioned, is not the best and sometimes requires several tries before it reads it. The stand-alone finger printer reader of the V20 was way more responsive. The magnetic charging adapter is kind of an annoyance to carry around, and it is for sure going to get loss. Try looking for a replacement, you'll be dumbfounded by the prices. Unlike the V20, the G8x does not have a replaceable battery, thus you eventually have to deal with a battery that doesn't hold a charge, but hopefully the phone will be replaced for other reasons before that happens. 
  
  I would give it 4.5 star if I could. The dual screen is a curse and a blessing at the same time, but I kind of knew that going in. It is a great phone (albeit no 5G capability) with great specs.

"This phone replaced an iPhone 7 that had some weird unexplainable issues. Features that separate the SE from that are as follows:
  
  - Better battery life by 2-3 hours (from her usage pattern, not mine)
  - Wireless charging
  - Portrait mode (Made possible by the A13 Bionic chip)
  - An additional gigabyte of ram
  - Roughly 3x the CPU performance
  - eSIM support
  
  I used to play a few multiplayer games over the phone with my girlfriend and she almost always experienced lag on her iPhone 7. At times, games like Call of Duty Mobile was unusable for her, and lag spikes would transport her to random places on the map. Now she doesn't experience any of the same issues; we can both carry our team again! The iPhone 7 base model only had 32gb of storage, and that's not enough for most people. My music library would take up a quarter of that! The SE starts out at 64gb, but offers 128gb and 256gb storage tiers. For a $50 premium, I believe the 128gb tier offers the best value since it doubles the base storage. Before I gave her the phone, I quickly compared performance throughout the operating system on different websites to the 11 Pro I use. The SE offers similar performance in everything except battery life and multitasking, but for a $450 phone, it definitely holds its own. I'd even consider buying another as a backup (my first 11 Pro unit had charging, booting, and display issues within a month!). 
  
  
  
  **Now that the iPhone XR's price has been cut due to the release of the 12 and 12 Pro, it'd be wise to compare the two.

"I've been a long time apple user and had decided to change it up since Apple removed their fingerprint scanner which was something I really liked even before having to wear a mask aaand they added widgets like it was some revolutionary feature even though android had been doing that for ages. I've made the switch from a XS and it did take a while to get used to the new OS but wow feature rich and super customizable. 
  
  The fingerprint scanner works great! And the fact that it's integrated in the screen is awesome. The facial recognition works well too. 
  
  The screen on this thing is good and with the 120hz it is sooo smooth. 
  
  Camera quality is overall pretty good and I think the portrait mode works a little better than my iPhone. 
  
  The battery lasts all day! I'll find myself finishing the day off with 40% at moderate usage (texting, social medias, YouTube videos). 
  
  Storage is fixed at 128gb but you get the benefit of expandable storage which is a huuuge plus. Love samsung for that. 
  
  The phone backing is really nice for being plastic but I throw a case on all my phones anyway. A shame because the red color is beautiful. 
  
  Overall a great phone for the money! A really good iPhone alternative especially since I spent over a grand on my last phone... didn't really feel like that was a good value at all. Won't ever do that again.",1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

If I move a little farther out, other Wifi devices I own are getting over 250 mps while the iPhone is either getting around 6 mps or not connecting at all. (Usually the latter.) I have multiple Wifi devices which get reasonable reception on my porch but the iPhone 6s can't connect at all.

"This rating falls on both AT&T and Best Buy. AT&T is doing away with 3G service so some unlocked phones - the majority - are no longer compatible. This happens to be one of the phones that falls into that category. As of today, it is still listed as being compatible with AT&T even though it is not. 
  I prefer unlocked phones because they usually do not have the bloatware most carriers add to a phone.

"Pros:
  - For those who prefer small compact phones
  - Has the A13 chip, giving it the CPU horsepower of the current iPhone 11 series
  - Is water resistant
  - Wireless charging
  - Display looks great, despite older generation Retina display
  - No intrusive notch
  - Touch ID for those who preferred it
  
  Cons:
  - Old school bezels are back, for those who are fully entrenched in the (nearly) full screen display form
  - No headphone jack (obviously)
  - Design is dated and despite all the pros, the charm can quickly wear off if you're not already a long time fan of this design
  - 3D touch replaced with more mediocre haptic touch
  - Battery life is average at best
  - Camera is decent, but not for picture taking enthusiasts
  
  Most of my pros and cons sum up what I think of this phone, so let me get to that ""However..."" from the title. I bought this phone, having eagerly awaited the next iPhone SE, which had been rumored under names like iPhone SE 2 and iPhone 9. But make no mistake, this phone is essentially an iPhone 8 with iPhone 11 internals. 
  
  I waited a long time to finally see the next iPhone SE come to fruition and I even preordered it on day 1 once it was officially announced. I knew this would be virtually identical to the iPhone 8 and I didn't mind this. The idea of the CPU being as fast as the iPhone 11, the Apple ecosystem and the phone being comfortably small for my pocket is what sold me...until I actually got the phone. 
  
  Don't get me wrong, this phone performs as awesomely as one can expect and then some. Games are buttery smooth and with the right case, the SE stands on its own merits. Unfortunately, I was also hoping that the more power efficient properties of the A13 chip would result in (even somewhat) longer battery life. That...turned out not to be true. 
  
  The battery is easily this phone's weakest link for even moderate users. If I'm lucky, I'll still have 10% left by the end of the day. But when my days can range from typical to using the phone more heavily, that 10% is too small a margin to be left with when you can easily run out of battery completely before the day is over. That's just unacceptable to me and very disappointing, considering the long anticipation for this phone. 
  
  I ended up having to get an Apple battery case (for the iPhone 7, since none is available for the iPhone 8 or SE, but it works just as well on this iPhone SE) in order to have enough battery power with get through the day with the heaviest use. Thing is, I shouldn't HAVE to require a battery case to get through a typical day. Rather, a battery case should be the exception, not the rule. 
  
  After having this phone for a little over a week, I find myself deciding that as much as I love everything else about it, the weak battery life ended up being a deal breaker for me and will be returning it soon. I wanted to like this phone. And maybe for those who would only use this phone lightly, the battery is ample for them. But for me, the charm of this newest iPhone SE wears off fast once you realize that its battery life gets eaten up too quickly. 
  
  If you still wish to buy this phone, please keep the battery situation in mind when you do. If you're into gaming, watch lots of vids and stream lots of music through bluetooth, you're likely to end up draining the battery completely before you go to bed and will end up having to recharge sooner than you want to. Otherwise, the iPhone SE performs as excellent as its iPhone 11 counterparts, minus the lacking camera and the other cons I listed.",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1

"My previous phone was the LG - V20 (lasted me 4 years). I definitely needed a new phone, so as with every large purchase, I searched thoroughly and chose the LG - G8X ThinQ Dual Screen with 128GB. I made the right decision. 
  
  PROS:
  One of the main reasons for my choice was that LG kept the manual video feature that allows the user to manually adjust the gain, low cut filter, and limiter. I'm a musician, so this is useful for recording my rehearsals, and performances 
  
  The dual-screen comes in handy. However, I primarily use it as a phone case and to place the keyboard on the main screen (on bottom) while viewing the text on the second (on top). I'm sure I will use if more often as more apps support the dual-screen feature. 
  
  All cameras on the phone are incredible. I look forward to discovering all the features on the phone including the ASMR feature. 
  
  I highly recommend this phone to anyone involved in the art–musicians, photographers, videographers, vloggers, etc.
  
  CONS: 
  If the dual-screen, in manual video mode, could be used as a monitor as it can in the normal video and selfie modes, that would be awesome. 
  
  This phone (outside of the dual-screen case) is EXTREMELY slippery. I do not recommend handling the phone without a case. It can be easily dropped and it can slide off of ANY surface with the slightest angle. 
  
  The fingerprint lock is disappointing and often frustrating. It worked flawlessly on the V20, however. 
  
  I also wish that the dual-screen had a removable protector for the rear camera.",1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1

"Be careful when purchasing this phone as Best Buy sales two variants of it. One variant has a microSD slot for expandable memory and the other has a dual SIM card tray. Before I walked out of the store with this phone, I specifically asked the guy behind the counter if this was the unit with the microSD slot. He didn't know. One could argue that they should know this information since they are selling you the product. But any ways, he couldn't find the answer online so he actually opened up the box and checked. He assured me that it did. Imagine my surprise when I got home and discovered that it didn't. Even with my old eyes I could clearly see that the tray said Dual SIM And of course this happened after the store had closed. I was fuming. I have stopped shopping at that particular location.

Helped me to choose the right phone for my wife's needs and took the time to go through it all again when I brought my wife in an hour later to educate her as well (the phone was for her). 
  We bought it and he took the time to transfer the data from her old phone to the new one - took at least 30 min of his time - and just was great to work with the whole time.

"While it has a decent camera, a great processor, good speakers, and a decent screen, this phone has its issues:
  1. The android skin provided with the phone is incredibly glitchy. The motion gestures don't work and it comes pre-loaded with bloat that you can't remove ( Galaxy Store, Bixby). The touch registers swipes as taps regularly. 
  
  2. The phone is surprisingly picky about what charging cables it works with, I have had to get brand new cables, where my last phone (lgG7) worked well.

"This phone is a game-changer! It allows true multitasking - not just switching between full-screen apps or working on two tiny windows - two full-size screens for your apps/games, etc.
  
  Sure the case itself is a bit bulky with the Dual Screen attached, but it's the only way to currently achieve a reliable foldable form factor that won't be prone to creasing/breaking like the Galaxy Fold. 
  
  The phone's Qualcomm 855 is powerful and the battery is enough for a full day if you're careful with dual screen usage. Luckily, you can simply place it on a wireless charger to top off the battery if you don't want to bring the magnetic adapter with you (or pop the phone out of the case to access the USB-C port). 
  
  Obviously you can get real work done on both screens, but you can also play games on one screen and get work done on the other one. 
  
  The in-screen fingerprint sensor is actually superior to the Note 10+ but it's still not as good as dedicated fingerprint readers. LG had some of the best on their V-series phones.

I bought this to replace an iPhone 5s that had only 16 Gb of storage. It is great having 128 GB. I will never have to worry about running out of storage. I just transferred the sim from my old phone and after a few steps of set up it was up and running. I had to get used to some different features but that was expected. The battery life is amazing.

"I bought the S20 FE to replace my excellent S8, and to be honest I don't think it is an improvement in any way that I would notice, and in fact has a few issues that are step backwards from the S8. The first, and probably most annoying, is the reaction time of the proximity sensor when you are making a phone call. If you move your phone away from your ear even a little bit, and then move it back the phone is so slow to hide the display that you will frequently end up hitting buttons with your ear. I had several instances where I ended calls, or switched to that annoying ""text while calling"" mode just by touching the screen with my ear. This is even more annoying because of issue #2, the touch screen responsiveness - or more accurately, the lack of. This is most noticeable when using an app, but does even happen sometimes when you are trying to open one. I can't count the number of times that I have had to touch an icon 2 or 3 times to get it to react. #3, and not as big an issue, but still an annoyance, is the fingerprint scanner. With the S8 the scanner was on the back of the phone, and pretty much always read your print on the first try. The S20, not so much; you almost always have to move your finger a couple of time for it to read, and it seems like you have to hold it in place longer too. Other than those things, the phone has worked very well, but again I don't really see much advantage over the S8. All in all, if I had it to do over I would not have bought this phone.",0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Had it since middle of Oct. 2020. MY GRIPES: (1) As usual, I have tried 3 times to dictate this and I watch it flashing, then it stops and types NOTHING. (2) It FREEZES all the time, no matter what app I am in. (3). When I dictate period at the end of a sentence or comma somewhere, it spells it out. (4) I had to turn off Auto Captitalize because it was capitalizing 3 or 4 words in the middle of every sentence. (5) It repeats text! Once it repeated 3 lines of text 15 times. (6) The cursor is not stationary. It jumps up and types in the middle of a prior sentence. Or if editing somewhere, the cursor jumps down and starts typing in the middle of another sentence. (7) I have problems with the simple task of copying and pasting! Won't work sometimes unless I type 1 letter 1st, then the Copy option will appear. And, in reverse, many times I get no Paste option unless I type in 1 letter 1st. (8) It is always inserting multiple words I didn't even say that I have to erase. (9) WORST, is their Contacts app. Yellow head, white shoulders and an orange background. I just noticed it a week or so ago. When I clicked on All Contacts, it shows Phone, where I back up my phone to and Verizon Cloud. Almost all Contacts had backed up to my phone. It was a nightmare to fix and get added where I 2anted them to be. I had duplicates galore. When I tried to delete or merge the duplicates, IT ADDS THEM BACK AS A 2nd Contact of the same person THAT CANNOT BE ERASED! I don't know it it is because this phone has Linked Accounts at the end of every contact! I think that is the problem. (10) I set alarms at soon as I have an event but app that came with phone does not put them in date order, so they are all over the place. Sometimes they even disappear. I have to recheck event alarms every week.

"I'm rating this 5 stars for the *value* you get with this phone. Especially since I got it at the pre-order price of $599 (which I believe may be the current price at the moment). 
  
  Prior to this, I've only bought Google branded phones since 2011 (though that phone was the Galaxy Nexus, which was made by Samsung, my last Samsung phone before this one). Then I had the Nexus 5, then the Nexus 6P, then the Pixel 2 XL, and now this. 
  
  Coming from pure Google experience phones, this took a bit to get used to. It's much heavier than the P2XL, but still feels good in the hand. 
  
  Basically, the phone is crazy fast, and has almost all of the latest tech you could want in a flagship, while giving up the most cutting edge stuff (that I don't notice, and many others likely won't), in order to bring the price back down to earth. 
  
  It has UFS 3.1 storage (as fast as you can currently get in an Android phone). 
  
  It has WiFi 6 (I don't have any WiFi 6 capable routers yet anyway). 
  
  It has a 120Hz display (which is awesome, but after loving that for a few weeks, I switched it to 60Hz, and I haven't regretted that move). The point is that it's your choice, and you can toggle whenever you want. 
  
  Cameras are very good (perhaps not Pixel quality, but they're definitely more versatile). ""One Shot"" mode is a ton of fun. 
  
  At $599, this is a no-brainer. At $699 (list), it's an exceptional value, but other phones at least enter the competition.",1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

"When my my Galaxy S7 finally decided to die, I read reviews for this phone which was also recommended by a Best Buy associate. The camera was the real selling point. I'm not a gamer or a streamer so my needs are pretty straightforward. The camera may or may not be great. It has been a real challenge to learn how to use it. And all other functions which were so easy to master and use on the S7 are now complicated. Functions are not the least bit intuitive. Samsung online support is useless.

"Got this this for my wife on Oct 31. After setting it and using the phone, it's is really worth the money. Even though it has a plastic back instead of a metal/glass back, it's still solid and wonderful looking. The refresh rate is amazing (120hz), the camera on it is as good as it gets for the money as it takes solid quality images. The focusing is super fast and responsive and the 3x zoom is something that most phones still don't have physically Although the screen is just 2400x1800 AMOLED not UHD 4K, you really cannot tell (tbh, unless you're a smartphone aficionado, you can't tell screens that small having great resolutions or not). 
  
  The battery size is great and unlike many flagship phones, it's bigger than most of them and it charges pretty fast. Bonus also that it has an expandable memory slot (1TB) which is located on the reverse side of the SIM card slot (first time I've ever seen that!). If I had one drawback for the phone is that this model could have used 8gig of RAM instead of six. I know this phone was made less expensive cutting certain features from the what's available on the other S20 models, but as cheap as RAM is, I think that could've been put in. 
  
  I have an S10 I got over a year ago, and it's just as good, even the camera is better and the FE has 5G with the 865 processor where my phone is max 4G LTE. The S10 is still more expensive than the S20 FE and it's screen refresh is at 60hz only. So, if you want an almost flagship type phone, and only have the bucks for the typical $500-$700 model today in that price range, this one is it!",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

The 120Hz refresh rate really isn't necessary unless you're a huge gamer so I switched it to the 60Hz setting; not much difference.

Another thing I love is that it’s prepaid so if we were to get him a contract we can just stop paying for the prepaid usage.,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Unboxing: nothing special here the box contains the phone, a charger, sim removal tool, charging cable, wired headphones. 
  
  Set up:
  Coming from a Flagship Android device I thought it would be a very tough task to transfer data from my Android to this Iphone SE second edition. I was wrong! 
  once I started the iphone it asked me if I want to get my data from another device and gave me the option of transfer from Android. 
  asked me to download an app called MOVE TO IOS. I downloaded the app and then followed the instructions and the transfer started wirelessly and took about an hour or so. 
  
  I restarted the phone, created an Apple ID, added my fingerprint, and went about to install my apps and import my Google accounts, and downloaded the latest IOS updates. 
  Restarted the phone again and started using the phone. 
  
  Experience:
  The phone is very snappy and fast, although you will notice some tracing while scrolling menus due to the lower refresh rate but the phone performs very very well and I can say that with this price point, nothing can beat this hardware and software Experience:
  The IPhone SE 2 has the latest A13 Bionec Chip, an OK screen size and quality, and a very nice camera compared to other phones in this price range. 
  
  Build Quality and design:
  The build quality is solid. it took me less than 3 hours to drop the phone from the table on hardwood floor flat on its screen. I thought the screen was shattered. I was wrong again. 
  the design is very similar to the IPhone 8 with its rounded edges and the silver frame with a glass front and back. 
  although when tapping on the screen with my finger nails, it feels more plastic than glass compared to my other phones. 
  the power button is located on the right side, and the volume rockers are located on the left side. 
  this phone does not have stereo jack and instead uses a lightning port (Thanks Apple! ), and dual stereo speakers at the button of the phone. 
  this phone still has a physical button on the left side above the volume rockers to switch to silent mode if you want to. and the sim card slot is located on the right side under the power button. 
  the finger print touch is located in the center of the screen at the buttom. 
  the phone has a double chin that measures about a half inch at the top and buttom. and the screen size is 4.7 inches (usable but would love bigger one for sure). 
  The phone is perfectly balanced and feels good in your hand even if you have a smaller hand. it doesn't feel lightweight and cheap but it doesnt feel and look like a flagship either. 
  the frame of the phone is made of metal. 
  the camera has a slight bump, and has a single camera on the back with a sensor and a flash. the camera app has Portrait, panoramic, slowmo, time- lapse, video, photo out of the box. 
  you can change the quality and size of the photos and videos and you can record videos of up to 4K with 60 frames per seconds which will cost you a hefty 400MG per minute of recording. 
  after setting up and importing the necessities from my other phone I was left with less than 20 GB of the 64GB this phone comes with. not much considering i am just done with setup and havent actually used the phone yet. but you can always upgrade to the 128 GB version of this phone. 
  Battery life:
  after using the phone with everything on out of the box I was able to get about 9 hours of continuous use and wast still left with 37% battery life. not bad considering that the phone has wireless charging capability and comes with a fast charging cable (but not a fast charger!). 
  Sound quality:
  the sound quality of this phone is OK, not great but its just good. the same goes for the included wired headphones. you can use them for sure, but we all know you are going to upgrade to those nice wireless pro's. 
  
  final thoughts:
  The IPhone SE 2 is a great cheap smart phone in the $400 range for any IOS or Android user. 
  the A13 Bionec chip is the latest and fastest IOS chip to date, its the same chip used in the flagship Iphone today. 
  the smaller screen with the less refresh rate and the older looking design are not deal breakers considering you are getting the same flawless experience from Apple. 
  I switched from Android to Apple for a few reasons:
  1- there are apps I need for work that are not available for Android (these are custom made Apps that I need in my day to day work)
  2- Security features: although Android has great customization capabilities, but security is still and issue. Apple is superior when it comes to protecting your privacy and security. 
  3- Some gimmick features that I see everyone around me love and use like Facetime, and impressions in Imessage. 
  
  finally, I would totally recommend this phone for anyone who wants to buy an affordable phone with great features and support that will last at least 3 years from Apple. this phone is also a great entry to IOS for anyone coming from Android family. 
  
  Last point: if you are an Android user and want to make the switch but afraid that your most valuable apps wont work, rest assured that everything from Google is available on the apple store even Google Authenticator. if you are missing some of Apple features with Android, you can make this leap of faith and will be happy with this purchase.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1

  No wall charger. Additional cost getting a fast charger.

I planned to keep it for awhile so went with the 128 GB of storage. The smaller size was important to me. I don't use my phone for music or videos and text 1 to 5 times a day. 
  I figured the smaller battery size would be adequate. WRONG! The first 2 weeks I already noticed how quickly it drained, so I adjusted settings and apps to decrease battery drain. But yesterday I realized just how bad it was. I used navigation for 60 minutes and took 40 pictures and my battery went from 97% to 38 % in 3 hours. I stopped taking pictures, using navigation and deleted Facebook as that appeared to use a large percentage of my battery. Over the next 2 hours my battery drained to 10%.

"The features promised do not work on this phone. The sensors for the biometrics are extremely flawed. The fingerprint option does not work. There are videos on YouTube that explain how you might be able to circumvent the problems, but it's just a temporary fix and after working once or twice, it goes back to not working. The face recognition also does not work 90% of the time. 
  As for the talk to text feature, which I need because I do find it hard to type, it either does not work or it will actually duplicate sentences in paragraphs multiple times. Sometimes their only duplicated once and the most ever counted was 5 times. 
  I am very disappointed in this product. I've turned to Samsung to provide quality products and this definitely does not meet up to the normal standards. I am stuck with it for a year before I can upgrade. When I do, it may not be Samsung anymore even though I've been very brand loyal.

"Phone is nice but have an Apple app that is not working correctly and have contacted Apple support several times and continued to be “escalated “ to the next level. Was told early on that they would replace the phone if this could not be fixed. Now told that is no longer an option. Have just passed the 3 week period with support, and now being told the hardware is okay, and now that the software is okay. Asked why it is still malfunctioning & could not get an answer. So once again, have gone through several steps with them turning controls off then back on. Then turning the phone off and back on, then going through to make sure the operating system is uptodate.

"It’s an iPhone, so everything just operates smoothly, build quality is premium as always with Apple of course.

"Great way to get access to an iPhone on a strict budget. You are essentially getting an iPhone 11 in the chassis of an iPhone 8, minus 2 of the 3 cameras the iPhone 11 gives you. It is an excellent phone for what it is. I guess now that the iPhone 11 is discounted thanks to the iPhone 12 release ($600) it is not AS good a deal as it was before the Sept 2020, but still for some people $400 out of pocket is more attractive than $600. Best Buy still seems to be selling the older box model of this unit (which is what I got store pickup), so you might get lucky and find yourself the proud owner of a pair of Earpods and power brick. Otherwise, iPhone SE boxes have gone the way of the 11 and 12 boxes - no Earpods, no power brick, just a single lightning cable.

"I took advantage of some BB reward points, and purchased an open box SE2. It was in like new condition, and quickly was operational due to the smooth transfer process Apple has by putting your prior phone next to the new one to activate. 
  
  For basic needs (phone calls, texts, etc) the upgrade really does not seem any different than the 7. While there are noticeable improvements in opening up apps and web pages seem faster, since it uses the A13 processor, I doubt I would have upgraded the phone without the reward points, as I don't play games or use any apps that are heavily graphics oriented on the phone. 
  
  It also takes the iPhone 7 or 8 cases, so that was easy enough to put on the new phone. I thought of purchasing the iPhone 11, but the model 12 is rumored to have 5G support, so I hold off on getting a larger iPhone until 5G is actually a useable reality for Verizon in our area. 
  
  I don't use the phone for serious pics (have a full frame Canon mirrorless for that use). It takes decent snaps though. I am attaching a couple of shots to this review.

"For $399, this phone is unbeatably priced. I dropped my Pixel 2, which I loved, into a tank of whiskey and it eventually gave up on this life. I wanted something small and reasonably priced and the SE is perfect. The brand new operating system is the same as in the 11 Pro and Pro Max so it’s very fast, snappy, and the screen is beautiful. 
  
  The setup was easy. I’ve never setup ban unlocked phone before and I was finished in less than 10min. Just swap the SIM card with the included tool (or spend 30min searching your house for something small enough to use) and you’re good to go. All of my contacts downloaded straight from the google cloud so going from android to apple was not difficult. 
  
  My two main complaints about this phone are the camera quality and the screen size. I know it sounds weird to complain about screen size when I wanted a small phone, but the SE kept the overlarge black bezels on the top and bottom of the screen, which takes up space that could’ve easily been covered by more screen. The camera works fine and it has all the modes like panorama, slow motion, and portrait but it’s just nowhere close to the Pixels or the 11 Pro and Pro Max.

  The mobile department manager doesn’t believe it’s a used S21 at the beginning but did a search in Bestbuy system and found this phone was indeed SOLD a couple days ago and got RETURNED, then someone restocked it as a BRAND NEW and sent to me. It’s a shame.

And it came with no bloatware, especially Facebook and things of that sort. It does come pre-installed with a bunch of Google apps and One Plus apps, but you'll probably keep most of those anyways. If not, you can remove any of them.",1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

"I'm going to split the review in a couple of categories. 
  
  Aesthetics:
  
  The case is not completely clear. It has a smokey tint, but it does compliment my violet phone. I'm not actually convinced it might look well with white, for example. 
  
  I think that may have been done to avoid the ""yellowing"" effect that most clear cases suffer from. When you look at it from a certain angle and from a certain light, it does show some light reflection that looks kinda like a rainbow. I don't know of what the exact term for it is. 
  
  It might be my hand grease. But there you go. 
  
  
  Grip:
  
  The phone's back is ridiculously slippery. I do think that the rubber grip around the casing does compensate for it, however. I'm not sure if it's Samsung or just shortcoming of the type of plastic used. 
  
  Protection:
  
  I've dropped my phone face first the other day and my phone is still intact. I've also dropped it a couple of times and landed around the corner and the rubber ""railing"" around the case seems to be absorbing the impact very well. And of course it is raised a couple of mm so the screen isn't flush with the floor. That said, I don't think this is quite a mouse or otterbox case, but for what it is, it provides decent protection from everyday drops. I wouldn't be conducting any experiments like dropping it from a crane, or tossing it up like a volleyball serve. Specially since I paid for my phone out of pocket. 
  
  I think for it's price, $40 it could be better. I wouldn't pay anything above 25-30. Like I said, it isn't completely clear which kinda defeats the purpose of a clear case.",0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"There is much to like about this phone: obviously the price, crisp speed and rich display. But in an apparent effort to simplify things, my user flexibility is reduced. Starting with and specifically, eliminating the 3.5mm jack for wired earbuds. One advantage of those earbuds is that I don't have to recharge them. Second, I can keep the phone on charge while talking. (Yeah, yeah, somebody said that's dangerous, but I've seen no evidence of that.) Next, while the DASH charger does deliver impressive speed, that means I have to carry the relatively large AC plug and, worst, its prongs don't fold down. Something most helpful when traveling. Equally bad is that the charging cord only works with USB C plugs on both ends, which means I can't easily jack into the standard USB connection in a car, airplane or bus so how are we to charge when traveling? Also, the charging system doesn't work with any magnetic connectors I can find, something that goes a long way to avoiding wear and tear on the female USB port in the phone. Finally, I find it very difficult to open the SIM card slot. Maybe it's unique to my phone, but frustrating nonetheless.

"The phone is a decent phone. The issue however is that calls goes silent as soon as the display gets turns off. Then you have to turn on the display for people on the other end to hear you again .

Data also suddenly drops and says your offline for no apparent reason. While the phone is decent , these issues prevent you from enjoying the phone . I would not recommend this phone.

"I use most new phones when they come out as I like to switch phones often and can because I buy them outright. That being said this is a great phone for the price of 800$ and even more so if you do a trade-in with the current BestBuy offer. I paid 200$ for this phone after trading in my iPhone 11 for $650 which was a great deal overall. 
  
  Spec-wise the s21 is using slow DDR memory than the s20 was, Also the back of the phone is no longer glass on this model. The Snapdragon 888 is faster than last year's offering and now the 5G chip is no longer separate it is combined so you will get better battery life. If you need expandable storage also this is not the phone to go with because you can not use a micro-sd like you could with the s20's
  
  This phone is a great upgrade if you are going from an s10 or older but if you have an s20 I would wait till next year to get a decent upgrade. 
  
  I think with covid going on and poor sales for the s20 series Samsung decided to cheapen the phones a bit down so people would be more likely to buy them. 
  
  At this price you are still getting:

"I owned Samsung phones from ~2013-2019, and transitioned to a Pixel in 2019. The transition took a little getting used to, but the UI was very intuitive and took about a week to adjust. When my Pixel broke, I wanted to get a Rokform case, which is only available for Samsung or Apple phones, so I decided to try the Galaxy S21. The case is great. The phone is not. 
  
  Transitioning back to the Samsung is not intuitive. It took multiple weeks to readjust to the Samsung UI, and after a couple months, I still occasionally use the wrong buttons or motions to try to do something. Screenshots work differently and seem more likely to accidentally change the volume. There is also no obvious way to turn the phone completely off when trying to save battery if spending the night outdoors away from a charger. 
  
  Related to the previous power statement, my 2 year old Pixel 3 had a longer battery life than my brand new Galaxy S21. It was even better when it was new. 
  
  Samsung filled my phone with a bunch of bloatware. Some were pretty obvious, like Samsung Health or their email apps. Others were less obvious, like their messaging app which uses an almost identical icon to Google's. I didn't realize that they had pulled a swap on me until all of my messages starting coming in broken last night. I called Google support and they suggested I update several apps, including Messages. Messages wasn't installed. Samsung had blocked it from transferring over when I copied all of my previous apps from the Pixel. I installed Google Messages, and everything was immediately fixed. 
  
  The fingerprint scanner only works about 1/4 of the time. I always have to scan multiple times, and get locked out and have to use my pin at least once per day. On the pixel, I might have had to rescan once a day, but I was never locked out. The Pixel would generally get it on the first scan, and occasionally the second or third. The Pixel's scanner is also much more conveniently placed on the back of the phone. One can scan a fingerprint and unlock the phone while pulling it out of the pocket instead of having to wait until you can see the phone and guess where the scanner is located on a blank screen. 
  
  This one is a bit more of a preference issue, but my thumb won't reach the entire keyboard. I can only type with both hands. The Pixel's screen was just slightly smaller, so I could still type with one hand if the other was full. 
  
  Lastly, although the Galaxy S21 says that it was designed to run on Google Fi, it doesn't seem to do this as well as the Pixel. Reception when out of wifi range was much more reliable with the Pixel. I have had several instances when out in a park or camping when I get zero signal with the Galaxy. This never happened with the Pixel. While I don't want to be glued to my phone when trying to enjoy the outdoors, I still want the option in cases of emergency...",0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1

"I bought this thinking iPhones would be good. I was wrong. This is about the least user-friendly phone I have ever had the misfortune of owning. Ways in which it is inferior to my prior Samsung include:
  - Can't drag photos from computer files in the phone---you have to use iTunes (nice vertical monopoly there, guys). 
  - Can't remove unwanted shortcuts from your home screen (I had to create folder on my home screen labeled ""Trash"" and shove them in there). 
  - Can't add contacts to your home screen (there's a workaround, but it requires the contacts to use symbols rather than pictures and it still takes multiple clicks to call). 
  - Can't change the color of basically anything (calendar+dark mode=slasher movie). 
  - Can't schedule quiet hours for only certain nights of the week, presumably because, as the alarm app patronizingly says, ""consistent sleep is the best sleep"" (I'm sorry, but you elites at Apple do realize that not every job allows you to sleep the same hours every night, right?). 
  
  This last point brings me to my other issue: How horribly patronizing this device is. Apparently, Apple views themselves as some sort of aristocratic elites who will heroically save the rabble from themselves by micromanaging their lives for them. Aside from the demeaning (and tone-deaf) advice about ""consistent sleep"" (yeah, that would be a nice luxury to have), you also have the Health app as one of the unremovable home screen icons (because apparently the ""rabble"" needs a tech company of all things to manage their health for them). If this was just an option, it might be helpful, but having it as one of the mandatory home screen icons just reeks of a patronizing and controlling attitude. 
  
  In short, Apple's message is: Don't worry your little head thinking for yourself, let us do your thinking for you, and remember, always buy Apple.

"I brought 64GB iPhone SE 2020 red color from BestBuy and its model number is MX9M2LL/A but came loaded with Verizon sim card in it. Why did it come with it when It's Unlocked?

Nice phone. This is my fourth Samsung Galaxy. I'm in my 70s and probably need to upgrade my phone but decided to replace my S7 because the camera didn't take good clear pictures. It has been difficult for me to set up and learn how to manage this phone. The system seems to require more steps than on my other Samsung phones.

"Overall I think this phone is a great value for the price. It has a great camera, and enough RAM and storage space for most uses. I tend to have a lot of apps open at once, and so far I have yet to notice a slow down. I have definitely enjoyed this phone with a couple exceptions. The phone seems to be a little glitchy. One of the main problems I have had is when doing a google search, the search sometimes doesn't show any results unless I hit search again several times. Another small issue is when touching the onscreen fingerprint reader, the accidental touch protection kicks in and I have to swipe it away and try the fingerprint reader again. The only other thing is getting used to Samsung wanting you to use their apps (phone, text messaging, etc.) as well as their backup cloud. These can be easily changed, so not a serious issue, and I knew this when buying this phone. This phone is not water resistant, so if you're looking for that, look at the Galaxy ""S"" series phones.

"The recent I phone SE that I have purchased are JUNK. I bought an IPhone 8+ less than two years ago. It completely died- unrepairable in less than 2 years. 
  I bought the SE model July 30th- IMMEDIATELY upon plugging it in to start to download my info from the cloud, it started heating up. 
  There was no case. It was in shaded room (not that ANY of that should make a difference. Are you saying you can’t use your phone except in extremely favorable conditions ). 
  That issue continued- and by 30 days in, it was becoming so hot that it was locking the phone......just normal use AND the battery was draining unbelievably quickly. 
  I took it to Best Buy- they replaced it. 
  30 days later, exact same problems with the new one. The battery was dropping so quickly that it went from 100% to 80 % in 20 minutes—NOT DOING ANYTHING. Later, that day, it went from 45% to 0% in one hour just while listening to music. 
  
  That’s when I took it to the Apple store. 
  
  Now, I wanted to trade it in for a different model. I can’t do that- is what the rep said. 
  He went through the diagnostic stuff- told me it wasn’t the phone- it was how I was using it. 
  
  I was like, I’ve had TONS of Apple products- never had these issues. While we were in store he watched as my battery continue to drain. He turned off automatic updates- and then we continued to watch the battery drop. 10% drop in less than an hour. 
  They told me they’d have to reset my phone- erase and download again. 
  We did that. 
  As soon as he turned it back on without downloading any of my stuff—the battery dropped more. 
  
  At that point, he agreed to provide a new phone- now, he didn’t add all my apps- he just added my SIM card- so none of my apps/email, etc was loaded to the phone—I put the brand new phone on the charger in my car—30 minutes later- not using it AT ALL- just charging it, it was hot to the touch. 
  
  Oh and the associate told me that I couldn’t add Apple care to the phone now because this is my third (IN TWO MONTHS) replacement—and if it continues to fail, they will only replace it with the same crap product.

"I have a Galaxy S10 Lite. A so-called watered down version of the S10+. It is almost 1.5 years old.

My phone, at just 50% brightness is brighter than the Oneplus 9 at about 60% brightness. Where the Oneplus 9 is brighter than my S10 is at 100%. But go ahead and put your phone at 100% brightness and tell me shortly thereafter how much battery you have left after, say, 5 hours of real world use, not just sitting on a table. On top of that, the 60 hertz refresh my phone has is actually faster than the Oneplus 9 at 120 hertz. As usual, paid video guys and girls are entirely wrong in their presentation of this unit. The one speaker at the bottom of my phone is almost as loud as the dual speaker system the Oneplus 9 has. It sounds nice, but nothing that gives off a wow factor. There is no way this phone should cost what it cost. Wireless charging is nice, I guess if that's your thing. And honestly, how many people reverse charge.

"I went from a samsung s10e, to iPhone 11proMax, (hated it) then back to samsung. I chose the Galaxy note 20.

But I just reset the settings within the computer application, and it connected immediately. So I'm assuming it was an issue with my PC. 
  The camera on the samsung is spectacular. The response on the phone is fast, I absolutely LOVE the pen feature as well. Definitely a huge selling point for me. (Haha get it?)

This phone is great it does not feel cheap at all even though it has a plastic back it feels like the same weight of the Galaxy s10 or s10+ the camera is great the response of the S Pen is great as well the screen looks amazing and even though it's at 60 hertz it feels way faster then my iPhone 11 did I actually like the fact that it has a plastic bag if it drops I don't have to worry about the back cracking or shattering and it also still has ip68 water resistance and wireless charging and reverse wireless charging the screen is great when playing on my Xbox game pass ultimate subscription and the phone is very loud and the screen gets very bright it's just a grate phone all my friends got the note20 ultra but I couldn't afford that phone but I'm very glad I got this phone it has 4K at 60 selfie camera for video and the same for the rear video and the fingerprint sensor is very accurate I also love this green color and it also comes with a 25-watt fast charger and it really does charge your phone super fast but it does not come with headphones but that doesn't bother me cuz I have Bluetooth headphones anyway overall I'm pleased with my purchase,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I wasn't expecting to like the Note20 5G as much as I do. I wasn't even planning on getting it, but Best Buy priced it just right and I almost went with another phone that wouldn't have satisfied me nearly as much as the Note20 5G. One of the things I enjoy about the phone is not only the large screen but also the nearly bezeless front of the phone. I also love that the front camera is just a small circle for the lens on the screen unlike the iPhone which has a large and ugly notch that takes away from the display area. This phone is fast, and the battery lasts me for 2 whole days with medium usage and 8 hours of screen on-time. I also have a lot of notifications come in on my phone but it doesn't kill the battery like my old S7 Edge did. You simply can't go wrong with this phone. The only flaw is that the back is plastic but I personally use a case with all my phones so this is not a dealbreaker for me.",1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"You have to try it for yourself. Forget about anyone's opinion, including mine. Why? Like anything in life, I have come to believe that reviews are SUPER subjective. You have to take into account that a review may be coming from a very young person that can be easily impressed and will give anything new 5 stars. It can be a snob that has to have everything perfect. It can be a person that received it as a gift and could care less about what anyone reads. Listen, it has a plastic back - SO! If it were glass, and dropped and cracked, the very person complaining about it having a plastic back will be most likely crying when they find out what it will take to repair a glass back. Is it slow? NO. You'll get someone to say it is. Is it snappy? YES. You will get someone to say it isn't. Do you need 120 hertz refresh? Give me a break. Moving fast in today's world is one of the reasons why so much in the world is screwed up to begin with. The speed at which you navigate any given website is MORE THAN ACCEPTABLE. Battery? You are going to get yet another person that says it won't last a day. SO! That very person probably lives on the phone and has forgotten there is a world around them. Standby time is excellent. Battery is super acceptable. The only adjustment I have made to the phone is lessening the brightness to 50% and it is still very bright. Calls are clear. Everything connects fast to it via bluetooth and stays connected. At the end of the day. If you need a good phone with a proven track record, and in this phone's case a stylus to make writing, typing, and keeping the screen as smudge free as possible, this is a great phone.",0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

"I had been an Apple user prior to owning this phone, but wanted to try something different this year. When doing my research on Android, I came across this hidden gem and I'm glad I did. The hardware is on par with other flagship phones of 2020. The fingerprint sensor on the power button is a nice touch, the shutter button makes taking pics a great experience, and while I don't personally use the Google assistant button that much, it's nice to have and doesn't get triggered accidentally very often 
  The display and 120 hz refresh rate are excellent. The audio (Dolby included) is top in class, plus a headphone jack. The battery life is phenomenal, and will easily last you all day. The only con I have is the selfie cam, it's just ok. I don't know why their main back cameras are so good, and yet the selfie camera is just passable. I don't take enough selfies for it to be a deal breaker, however. All in all, the Sony Xperia is a jack of all trades and mastered most of them quite well.",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

"The cameras, the S-pen, the AMOLED screen quality, the 120 Hz refresh rate, the 5G data connection, the build quality, etc. are all top notch. This phone will probably hold the crown for best Android phone for a good while, and it has key feature bumps that made me especially want this phone--namely the 5G and the 120 Hz screen. 
  
  I would definitely recommend a solid case if you're planning to spend this much money on a phone. I bought a Spigen case which effectively reduces the camera bump on the back to allow the phone to sit flat on a desk. The IP68 rating means that it will be fine with water and dust, but drop protection is still a must. I saw a stat recently that something like 2/3 of people report incurring drop damage to their phone (for all phones not specifically this phone). 
  
  Other thoughts: I think it's interesting that most middle class people can afford the best phone that you can possibly purchase for a product that is in your pocket, everyday, all the time. You can't say that about cars, houses, clothes, but you could definitely swing buying the best phone that money can buy once every 3-4 years if it's important enough to you. For me it is, and I'm very happy with this phone. 
  
  Lastly: Google Pixel, 1+, Apple, etc. can only hope to match some of the features that this phone has to offer, but I highly doubt that they will exceed this phone's specs on yet to be release products. Just my opinion as a phone guy, but the best that they could hope to do is give you a better value on specific features.

Second, the S-Pen is the whole reason I'm a Note user. It's my main buying reason. They moved the S-Pen slot from the right side to the left side of the bottom of the phone. Assuming most people are right handed, it is definitely more cumbersome to retract and replace the pen. I can't figure out the right place to put my left hand when replacing the pen - my finger hits the on/off button and closes the screen, or the phone rotates from portrait to landscape - very disappointing.

But the thing that made me sell this phone was all the random ads Samsung would push as notifications from various apps. Even after disabling notifications from ALL Samsung apps they pushed another ad to my phone via the system UI and it was time to go.

The Samsung Galaxy S20 plus must say is the best balance between the S20 altra in regular S20 related for a big screen but not a bulky camera and a bigger battery but not too big as in all tra is the perfect phone balance in my opinion it has all the same specs as the S20S20 offer besides having a slightly smaller battery in the ultra obviously a bigger battery than ast one in a bigger screen so if you don't want that big camera bomb to S20 all trained you don't mind a slightly smaller screen this is the phone for you,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Feels like an improved version of the S10+ but it is a little more than that. 
  
  I upgraded from the S10+ and felt SOME difference - for the better of course. 
  
  Camera is better, in-display fingerprint is better, the screen itself feels and looks better, the whole arrangement feels better. 
  
  Ok, the front facing camera could be hidden by now, but I understand they have a schedule to do that - baby steps to milk our money every year... 
  
  The biggest difference for me was 5G. OMG! How have we lived without for sooo long?! (yeah yeah, Note10 had a 5G version but who cares? That thing was a tablet!) 
  I don't have tiny hands but the Note is WAAAAY too much to handle....

"Excellent phone overall, except for the fingerprint scanner. I upgraded from the S8 so definitely experiencing all the latest improvements Samsung has made in the past few years from the clear and fast responsive screen to the great camera features from stabilization to fairly low light video and pictures it takes. Also battery life is very decent, can run a normal day of work and play on a single charge and even if I run low on longer days the recharge capabilities is fast. Just can't believe the fingerprint scanner couldn't be any better for such a high tech premium phone but will not knock a star since it's my only gripe and all other features has me stoked.

Great camera. The only complaint I have is the ringtones that are programmed into the phone. I miss the ringtones from the S9 and it only allows the preprogrammed ringtones to be set as a contact ringtone for text notifications. My favorite sound for texts was dew drop and it is not there. The other sound of rington I miss is the sound of a typical alarm and the morning glory sound. But thats just being nit picky. The only other downside is there is no actual power button.

  With this dvd player it has 2 HDMI spots one for the tv and one for sound if you have a sound system i think. 
  I dont have or need a sound system but compared to the playstation the picture is better but the sound is terrible. I have to raise it to like 90/95 out of 100 to here well when watching through this bluray player. Its like they are trying to force you to buy a sound system.

"I have been wanting a new phone for a while now, as I was running a LG V30 for sometime. Prior to that I had the old Nexus 5, which was a great phone for the day and I loved it then. I originally ordered a Pixel 4XL to replace the LG in hopes it would check the warm & fuzzy boxes like the old Nexus did for me. It didn't (no Ultra-Wide camera was a HUGE mistake!). So I returned it, and researched for a few months. Finally pulled the trigger on the regular S20 (unlocked). Sooooo glad I did. The feel in hand is terrific. It feels smaller in the hand than my LG V30, but you actually have more screen real estate. Just a terrific fit/finish and form factor here. I actually wanted a smaller, one-handed phone for convenience as I take a LOT of photos in my profession (home inspection). It is very fast, and the camera has been great so far. I have pretty much turned off all the Samsung bloatware I could and have it as close to Pure Android as I can, and it is terrific.

"After a week of use, I am enjoying the optical zoom, 5G coverage is decent in my area and the phone is much faster than my S8+. So I am happy with my purchase. 
  
  The drawbacks - the phone is a bit overpriced, and Samsung has started putting advertising in their apps which drives me nutzo. Use the music app? Every 7 days it tries to sell you Spotify, no matter that the app already includes Spotify and I have Spotify installed on the phone. Eew. That might be a reason for some to switch to Apple at a comparable price point. 
  
  On the plus side, compared to the S8, it is very easy to ignore Bixby (Samsung's Siri like thing). Sadly they stuck a news app where Bixby used to reside if you swipe left of the 1st home page. Really - neither Apple nor Samsung or Microsoft for that matter should be trying to be a news outlet. A (smart)phone should be a (smart)phone.

"Long time iphone user here. My first smart phone was an iphone. I then had a galaxy for a short while, it didn't last long because this was when android was a little unstable. I went back to iphone and I've been getting iphones for 9 years now. Never had any complaints, they did just want I needed and I have other apple products, so the ecosystem worked great. However, in recent years, I started questioning some of Apple's business choices and I feel like iphones weren't changing enough. But I felt like I needed to make a change. I did my research and I knew Samsung had better specs, options, and they were running on android, an OS that would allow me to be in more control. I wanted to make the switch. But I was struggling to leave Apple's ecosystem. Around the time iphone 12 was revealed, I saw the S20 in the store and was amazed by the high quality screen, it's speed and responsiveness. I had to learn more. So I watched some videos on YouTube and did a ton of research, including what I'd be missing from not having an iphone and what I'd be gaining from an android. I found more reasons to switch. And here we are and so far I have no regrets.",0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

"My girlfriend loves her new Galaxy S20+ 128GB Cloud Blue phone that I got for her birthday! She upgraded from a Galaxy S7 that was starting to slow down. Mine is still the Galaxy S8, and I'm still okay with my phone. I thought the S20+ might be too big, but it's only slightly larger than my S8. The S20+ is sweet though--charges very quickly, holds a charge more than 1 day with heavy use, and it's lighting fast compared to our older phones. The camera's on this phone are so good. You'll never need a separate camera anymore for trips, as this camera is that good!! Oh, and the setup and transfer of apps and data to S20+ was very easy and quick via wireless between the old and new phone.

"Pros: I have enjoyed using this phone thoroughly since I purchased it. I love the screen size and clarity of the picture quality! It also has an all day battery that keeps up with me! Camera is also great, and installing an additional memory card was a cinch. I also enjoy 5G coverage in my area. For an average user, this is a great phone! 
  
  Cons: Not too sure about all the other benefits of ownership of this phone. However, there are some drawbacks. I miss the aux headphone port. Although it did come with some headphones that use the power-port to also transmit audio. Guess there's no avoiding this now! Also, when running on max settings, the phone tends to have about 50-70% of the normal battery life that I enjoy while running on lower settings. The phone was also a little pricey, and I'm having to reassess if the phone really is worth the premium price considering other options and the use of an ""average"" user.

It will give you so many notifications using the default setting you have to go in and weed out the silly stuff. The hardware is superb. My battery life is great although I am not a power user.

The bezels are practically non-existent and while the punch hole isn't as elegant as some more experimental phones with pop up selfie cams, I hardly notice it in use.

"This iPhone from fApple actally works very, very well. I have had noting but trouble from my Motorola Z3 Play and Android Auto.

  Via CarPlay in my Dodge Ram (I have not yet tested it in my Mustang but when I do I shall edit this review to reflect that experience) this iPhone does what I ask of it.

"Upgraded from a galaxy s9. Don't get me wrong. This isn't a bad phone. But it does miss the mark in a few areas where I feel it counts. I'll start with the pros first. 
  
  - The camera: coming from the s9 I do see some improvements notably in the software. Features which appear to be exclusive solely to the s21 ultra do to it having 4 cameras. Also has laser focus. 
  
  - The display: As always, Samsungs displays never cease to impress me. Though if you want the WQHD, you'll need to shell out the extra cash for the s21 ultra. The s21 and the s21+ feature only 1080p displays. 
  
  - Overall build - the physical built overall is quite nice. The back is plastic but not cheap plastic. Not a finger print magnet like it's predecessors. Metal frame and a nearly bezzless display combined to make a quite nice, even sophisticated package, though not a wide range of colors at launch. But for me, as long as I have my black, I don't care. So I subtract no points. 
  
  - Processor: Each new phone typically boasts the usual ""more powerful processor"" claim. I haven't put it through benchmark tests but from real world use, the OS is quite snappy and moving from app to app and menu to menu has no lag at all. Overall a pleasant experience. 
  
  - Battery life: The s21 features a much larger battery the the s21 and s21+. Two days in so far and it seems to hold up to daily activities rather well (texting, some light gaming, facebook, etc...) 
  
  - S Pen: if you just so happen to have an S Pen from an old Note or Galaxy Tab, it will absoluty and finally work on the Galaxy S line of phones. Though there is no storage on the phone itself for the pen, but you can purchase a case that has an integrated S Pen holder. 
  
  Okay. Now for the CONS.... 
  
  - Camera: Now I know what you must be thinking. ""But you said the camera was a PRO"". Yes I did. However, even with the various software and hardware improvements, the image quality does not seem to be so strikingly amazing compared to my s9. Even when shooting in 108mp mode, the results seem only marginally better. Adding to this, I don't believe the sensor is truly 108mp, rather each mp is divided into 9 parts allowing the sensor to capture more detail and thusly produce an (in my experience) somewhat sharper image. Furthermore, I do not understand what the point is to put so many cameras into a phone. Sure you have your telephoto, for example, which should enable you to maybe get a nice shot of the moon. However, if lunarphotography or any other kind of long range shooting interests you, even an entry level DSLR will yield far superior results. My opinion: leave smart phone to the selfies and MAYBE wide angle. Leave everything else to actual cameras. It will make room for other things like my next point. 
  
  - 3.5mm Headphone/Mic input: The modern smartphones have become an especially handy and even accessible solution for vlogging. With the ability to shoot 4k and the s21 ultras 8k, you can yield some very acceptable results and very easily. But good video does not make up for garbage audio. And unless you are using a mic, garbage is what you will get. I don't care what smartphone you are using. The other reason the removal of the 3.5mm jack is problematic will become painfully clear if you're somebody who flies a lot. Once you put you're phone in airplane or flight mode, those Galaxy Buds Pros you just bought will be of no use to you. Now I'm sure there is a USB-C to 3.5mm adapter available, but my point stands and for this the entire s21 lineup loses 1 star. 
  
  - Expandable storage: Samsung have we not been down this road before? I know you guys know how much people value the option for expandable storage. Say goodbye to another star. 
  
  - No headphones or charge brick in the box: In an age where every single thing comes with a charge brick, I think this was probably a good move. We all have 500 of those kicking around at this point. But the lack of headphones is unacceptable. A decent pair of USB-C headphones absolutely should have been in the box. At the very least, a USB-C to 3.5mm adapter given that they removed the jack. 
  
  - Fingerprint sensor: Theres not much I can say other than that it has so far been nothing short of a frustrating experience. It was MUCH better on the s9 and when it was on the back of the phone as compared to under the display on the front. Maybe the next iteration will return to this design in lieu of featuring 75 different cameras. 
  
  I hope some of you find this review to be insightfull given that you will potentially be spending upwards of $1,000.00 or more on this phone. Again, I don't totally hate the phone but it feels as though there has been a bit of a departure from past years in terms of Samsung listening to the desires of the consumer. I think this will be something that will hurt them in the bigger picture.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1

"Phone is extremely overpriced, it should be worth around $700 at most. There are also literal ads within some apps - imagine paying for a phone (especially over $1000), thinking you own it, and still having ads playing inside the phone - this is alone enough for me not to want to use this phone. 
  
  Some things people don't talk about:
  1. Cameras are good but the UI in the camera software is not that great (except for Pro mode, which is pretty nice). 
  2. The software experience overall isn't very intuitive. There are some settings which are buried deep within the Settings app. It's also not very friendly with Google Photos (for example, every time you want to delete a photo using Google Photos, it will ask you via prompt if you're really sure you want to give Google Photos access). 
  3. Google Maps access - this is one of the most infuriating & potential harmful issues. Typically you'd imagine that any navigation apps (Google Maps, Waze, etc.) would need access to the phone's GPS all the time by default. This is not the case in this phone for some reason. When you open up Google Maps, it will ask you via a prompt if you want to give Maps access to the GPS either only this one time, only when the app is open, or not at all. The option to give Maps access to GPS all the time isn't available unless you dig deep into the settings & grant the Maps app permission separately - this is such a stupid design especially if you expect Maps or other navigation apps to just work normally as they should. Granting the app access to GPS only when the app is open doesn't work if the app isn't in the foreground - for example, if you get a call while you're driving and Maps gets minimized and the Phone app opens, then GPS & route navigation will be lost - imagine dealing with that while you're driving trying to navigate. 
  4. Ads - this is another infuriating issue. Why are there ads in a phone that I paid full price for, and on top of that one that is unlocked fully? There is no option to turn off ads in the settings and Samsung has very predatory setup process when you first setup your phone - it will automatically opt-in for sending them personal data and showing ads. There is a very jank way to disable ads and it's not supported natively within the Settings of the phone - in other words, you're paying over $1000 for a smartphone that will have ads. This is absurd and absolutely unnecessary. 
  
  If this phone was $700 I would still be annoyed with all those things but slightly less. If this phone was $400, I probably wouldn't complain that much about most of these issues. But at over $1000, this is ridiculous at best and people should find these practices unacceptable.",1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1

"For the first time I don't have to deal with all the bloatware that the major carriers install on the phones bought through them, this unlocked phone is awesome. 
  
  My previous phone was an S7 Active which served me well but I wanted to upgrade to an unlocked phone to switch to Mint Mobile(which was an excellent choice) from AT&T. 
  
  Since I had a Samsung account it was easy to transfer everything over through the cloud, same thing with Google transferring stuff over as well. 
  
  I would recommend getting an ArmadilloTek case for it off of Amazon, it's a nicely designed case and the material has good grip so it stays in your hands.

"I bought the Galaxy A51 after my Galaxy S5 Active all of the sudden died (after at least 5 years). I did not want to pay $1K for one of the flagship Samsung phones, so I bought the Galaxy A51 outright (AT&T). 
  
  I was back & forth between the Galaxy A51 and the Google Pixel 4a (same price $349). After looking at both, I went with the Samsung - the Pixel 4a doesn't allow for a MicroSD card, and per reviews doesn't have a dedicated ""back"" button. Also, there's an obvious size difference. 
  
  
  Pros:
  - Supports a MicroSD card (the Pixel 4a does not) and the phone comes with a SIM/MicroSD card slot tool, for replacement. Which was a nice touch, not having to dig for a paper clip or thumb tack. 
  - Battery life -- I've seen some reviews critical of the battery life, but to me the battery has been exceptional. I get at least 24 hours on my battery (screen brightness at 30% which is well enough for me & have the ""dark theme/mode"" enabled, I also am not utilizing Samsung apps: Bixby/Free/Edge). And I'm on Twitter/Email/Slack constantly. 
  - Camera -- Great main camera... great resolution on regular pics & excellent zoom, great panoramic pics, decent resolution on videos. The front facing (selfie) camera is also good - good resolution & has easy selfie picture function. 
  - It does have an earphone jack (as does the Pixel 4a), which is a must for me. More on that below. 
  
  
  Cons:
  - No ""hard"" buttons at the bottom for: apps/home/back, like my previous Galaxy S5 Active had. For me personally, the soft/touch screen buttons will take some getting used to, but for others it's probably not a big deal. Just my personal preference. (To note: I've read reviews where the Pixel 4a does not have a back button, you have to swipe)
  - The default wallpaper and icons (phone/text/camera/pics) are quite ""cartoonish"" or childish looking (pictures attached). The app icons looked nothing like my 5 year old Galaxy S5 icons & wallpaper. There are free themes/wallpapers/icons you can download, but out of the box it's a disappointment. But, for a budget phone I can live with it. 
  
  
  Other observations:
  - Obviously, it comes preloaded with all of the Google apps, some Microsoft Office apps, which I use. And of course some of the Samsung bloatware apps, but that hasn't been a problem for my usage or battery life. I had to set Chrome as the default browser, instead of Samsung's native browser. 
  - On phone calls, unless you hold the phone close to your ear/face in ""just the right way""... the touchscreen will re-engage - which could have the potential for your cheek to hang up on the call. It hasn't happened to me yet, but I've noticed it's very particular about how you hold the phone while on a call. 
  - The earphone jack is located on the bottom (versus at the top for my previous Galaxy S5 & the Pixel 4a). First phone I've had that had it at the bottom... but after some usage, I'm getting used to it - if you have headphones wired in & put your phone in your pocket ""top down"" it makes sense. 
  - I've already dropped the phone onto concrete from about 2 feet high, luckily no damage. I have the $20 UAG case from Best Buy, which is more firm rubber than the $30 UAG case. The $20 UAG case makes it a bit harder to press the volume & 'action' buttons on the side, so consider the $30 UAG case which is softer & should allow for easier pressing of the side buttons. 
  
  All in all, this is an excellent phone for the money. I would definitely buy again, and recommend to anyone not wanting to drop $1K on a phone.",1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1

  It runs fast with virtually no lag between apps. I don't play mobile games so I can't tell it's frame rate specs. The display is very bright and detailed even though I have it on low settings. The battery life is longer than my prev phones. In an average 8 hour work day of minimal usage (checking Instagram and making phone calls) I only lose 10 to 15% battery life and fast charging is pretty fast. I get 70% to 100% in 20 minutes which ain't bad.

Also when typing a text message on the keyboard, you can either type or hit the microphone but you can't use both features in the same message.

I was very upset after leaving the store we had travel plans. The sales person was supposed to pay for the phones with our debit card. He scanned our debit card so I thought everything had gone correctly. Yes I agreed to a Best Buy card to get a discount but the purchase was supposed to be to our debit card. That was the first disappointment. We purchased covers for our phones before traveling. When we arrived in Denver we purchased glass protection while putting on the protection my phone glass was cracked at the upper 1/3 area completely across. Because we had been traveling in poor lighting we had not noticed this crack. The phone had not been dropped or mishandled in any way. We contacted Best Buy about the payment problem and the damage and they fixed the payment but said they could do nothing about the damage even though it was under the 1 month warranty and 1 year samsung warranty.

"This device is gold. I sprung for the 256G option because there is no MicroSD support but the cost increase isn't great. In summary, the device is perfect fit for the hand, looks great, performs like a beast and makes minimal compromise. 
  
  Unboxing / setup:
  There is minimal in the box, a USB-C to USB-C cable, documentation, a SIM tool and the phone. Setup takes some time if you are porting from another phone but the Samsung Smart Switch app makes it pretty easy where all you have to do is transfer all software, log in to Google and Samsung and it will do the rest, it just takes time to do so. 
  
  Use: 
  Battery life was lacking in the first few days but once it learned my habits after three or so days, I finish the day with 20% battery and 4-5 hours screen on time with 5G T-Mobile service in my area. I watch a lot of YouTube, read books, message, social media and game though out the day. 
  
  What I was most impressed with is how well this phone fits in the hand. It is near perfect for small/medium hands. Most of the screen is reachable and one-handed texting is easy. 
  
  The plastic back is a non-issue for me since it still feels premium and I use a case anyway. The Phantom Grey looks much better in person than in the product photos. 
  
  The lack of Micro SD is a good move even if it is hard to swallow in my opinion. The reason I say this is the performance increase. Most faster Micro SD cards only read at 90 MBps whereas the UFS 3.0 built in provides 1748 MBps read, 756 MBps write which is outstanding! The price increase for the 128 GB is only $50 extra which is only a tiny bit more than a 128GB microSD card. I do understand the pain if you need more than 256GB though. 
  
  Performance was a little choppy the first day or two as I assume the phone was indexing the filesystem and cleaning up after smart switch, but in the week since, zero issues. Performance on benchmarks is not on PAR with iPhones but you wouldn't notice in day to day use as apps open even faster. 
  
  Camera:
  There is a bit of shutter lag, but if you can live with that, photos area AMAZING! I must disclose that the 3x camera is not optical in nature. It is a cropped 64MP sensor. Side by side to an S21 Ultra with an optical 10MP 3X, the difference is almost unnoticeable. The phone allows digital zoom up to 30x but I wouldn't go higher than 10x as it is unusable after that. There is no macro ability but if yo use the 3x, it gives you pretty close photos. 
  
  Sound: 
  Speaker quality is great! I can easily hear it playing music or podcasts while showering and it gets loud and clear. The phone supports all the big codecs via bluetooth and I recommend Samsung buds of any type as it supports a Samsung Scalable Codec. 
  
  Display: 
  I was worried about the 1080p display being too low, but it is an extremely good screen! It is bright, vibrant and detailed as the screen size is low. 
  
  Connectivity: 
  Calls are clear especially on HD calls. I have a Wifi 6 network and connection stays strong anywhere in my house. Switching from an iPhone 12 Pro, I noticed cellular signal on 4G LTE and 5G is stronger anywhere I am in comparison. I have got up to 650mbps via 5G midband as there is no mmwave in my area.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1

  -This phone does have a very nice feel and good size to it (don't listen to people misrepresenting it as ""plastic"", the finish and material feel to me exactly like my last phone, the iPhone 11 Pro)
  -It is very fast with a great screen, 120 Hz is snappy, 5G seems a little faster than LTE but not that much honestly. 
  -Battery life seems good so far. 
  -Software works well, UI is just as intuitive as apple in my opinion. With more customization options. 
  
  The bad:
  -No charger in the box, this is honestly an insult to someone who just switched from iPhone and needed a charger. What on Earth were the clueless Samsung folks thinking with this decision I'll never know. (Other than ""oh let's do it if apple is doing it"")
  -No headphone port. That was one of the reasons I was excited to switch back to Samsung, my old S8 had a headphone port which I was missing. Another insult to the consumer...how many people were actually giving feedback that they didn't want the port? Clearly they were just copying apple's anti-consumer behavior. 
  -Why not have a black color option for all models? This gray is not bad but you'd have so many more people switching over if you had a proper black option in the entry model. Not everyone wants a huge phone (which is the only reason I didn't opt for the plus or ultra...this is a huge wasted opportunity for Samsung to capture a larger audience)
  -limited to just 256GB if I want a phone I can use with one hand? Either offer a 512GB option or give the ability to put a microSD card in. This was also a very sloppy decision by Samsung too. 
  
  In general Samsung continues to throw away big opportunities to win over former iPhone customers. Get your act together Samsung, you have a chance to be better than Apple. I hesitated a lot before trying this phone...over things you could have easily fixed with minimal impact to your costs. And they would go a long way towards winning over hearts of consumers.",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Love it. I've had every iPhone from the 3GS in 2009 all the way up to the XS Max in 2018. The only other phone I had in that time frame was the Galaxy S8+ in 2017 which I really liked. I also got the iPhone 12 Pro at launch so I actually am able to compare these two. But so far I've really enjoyed all that the S21 and Android has to offer. I like learning different operating systems and Android/Samsung's UI has come a long way since 20117 and the Galaxy S8. As mainly an Apple user, there are things Android DEFINITELY does better than iOS and vice versa. I love how customizable Android is. 
  
  As far as the S21 I went with the base level because I'm to the point now where I don't want to go over 6.2 or 6.3 inches for a phone. The camera quality on the S21 blows me away. I think it's better/more vibrant than the 12 Pro. Also the screen gets SO bright which I love! Samsung screens on the phones and TV's are top notch and I WISH my iPhone got this bright.

"If you want the latest and greatest from Samsung this is it. Although you will find cheaper phones with similar specs so if you're looking for bang for the buck look elsewhere.

"I've bought the latest Samsung phone every year since the Galaxy S3. I've also loved all of them except the S5 and the S20. 
  
  The only reason this is getting good reviews is because the other options on the market are so weak. The reality is that the Galaxy S20 is a terrible showing from Samsung, for the following reasons:
  
  - Battery life is overall abysmal - I suppose this is due to the 120 Hz screen and 5G...but it stands out so poorly after I was so happy with the S10 battery life which could go on for multiple days). Samsung, no one wants to keep charging their phone every few hours. 
  
  - The phone is heavier, bulkier, and looks awful compared to past Galaxy phones. (The extra bulk doesn't even get me better battery life as it normally would on other phones...see first point). The gorgeous curved screens of past generations are reduced too dramatically that it feels like they aren't even there anymore, the color choice is awful if you want the regular sized Galaxy phone, and it just looks more like my wife's iPhone now. Thank god at least they didn't adopt the notch. 
  
  - The lack of headphone jack - why are you forcing the dongle life on us? This is one of the biggest reasons even my friends picked Samsung over Apple the last few generations. Clearly that extra space for increasing the battery size has not provided any benefits. Some of us have nice headphones and considering the frequency you expect us to charge the phone (see battery life point) why should we have to buy dongles to listen to music while we charge the phone? This one is a real slap in the face by Samsung. 
  
  Again, the only reason this phone is getting good reviews is because other offerings on the market are pretty bad too. If you compare this Galaxy phone to past generations, this is arguably the worst phone offering ever from Samsung. Though the Galaxy S5 is giving it a good run for its money. As far as overall Samsung offerings, this is as garbage of a product as Samsung ARTIK. 
  
  One more spectacular blunder like this and Samsung has lost another long time fan.

"I have been a fan of of the Samsung Galaxy S series for seven years now, having had five devices in the series starting from the Galaxy S3. My favorite new feature on the Galaxy S20 is the 120hz refresh rate; it makes scrolling and transitioning through pages and apps a seamless experience. The only downside, though, is that going back to 60hz will make the phone seem noticeably slower. However, I always keep my phone on 120hz, so I do not come across that issue. I find that using the 120hz refresh rate does not drastically decrease the battery; I use my phone moderately and have never had my fully charged phone run out of battery at the end of a day's use. 
  
  Camera: I upgraded from the Samsung Galaxy S9, and I noticed a significant improvement in the front-facing camera on the S20. Images and videos are more clear and crisp. The rear camera also appears to have improved, but not significantly because I found that the camera on the S9 was excellent. I do not use the more advanced features on the camera/video, so I cannot speak on those. 
  
  Build Quality: The S20's lightweight aluminum build feels great. The S20 is much longer than it is wide (it is a tall phone), so it can be a bit awkward for me to use single-handedly. However, there is a single-handed mode in the features, which helps. 
  
  Super Fast-charging: The fast charging is, well, very fast, and I love it. The phone charges from 0% to 100% in about an hour. The charging cable that comes with the phone is also very sturdy and durable. Previous phone chargers would wear out much more quickly. 
  
  Ultrasonic fingerprint reader: Coming from the S9, I like the fingerprint sensor on the S20. However, it took me a few tries to get all of the angles for my fingerprint so that the fingerprint sensor worked accurately at various angles.

  The phone's processor is extremely powerful. Even with multiple apps open there is never a glitch or slow down. Everything is fast, smooth and reliable. I use my screen in 120hz mode and videos, animations, and scrolling are the smoothest I've seen on any screen anywhere. Expert reviews say 120hz drains battery faster but I get through a full day of use with power to spare. If you're a super heavy user you can switch to 60hz mode to save power. It's still great but not quite as buttery smooth. 
  
  I'm not a gamer so I can't address that. Everything else I do on this phone is smooth and effortless. For example, Android Auto with my old Nexus 6P worked, but everything was laggy and sometimes glitchy. I thought it was Android Auto problem because 6P was a decent phone. Nope. Galaxy S20 runs it fast and solid with no glitches. My in-car experience is way better now. 
  
  The more I live with this phone on a daily basis the more I like it. It is a great tool that enhances my experience no matter what I'm using it for. 
  
  I agree the S20 line is very expensive, but if you don't need the huge screen on the plus or ultra (I actually like the smaller pocketable size better), the S20 cost is in line with other flagship phones and is a top quality product. 
  
  Watch for sales and promotions. This unlocked version was $200 off for a short time so I snatched one. Btw I use this on T-Mobile and it works great for cellular and 4g LTE. There's no 5g in my area yet so I haven't tested that yet.",1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

says works with several carriers. But it does not. You will be able to get calls and texts nothing else. If that's all I wanted I would get a cheap tracfone.

Since then, I’ve owned almost every one they’ve come out with, hoping it would win me back from iPhone and Pixel. Their screen is always so enticing, but then the experience just lets me down. I usually end up selling them or returning them. But this year they didn’t disappoint. I actually opted for the smallest version because phones are getting so big and expensive it’s ridiculous! I’m so glad I did. I don’t feel like I’m missing out on anything at all with the S20, and I’ve even heard lots of bad reviews about the overly priced Ultra. It takes great pictures, has good battery life, and is very lightweight. Also, I’m so glad they got rid of that curved screen for the most part. I hated that. I can’t speak for everyone, but I feel like Samsung did a great job this year on the S20.",0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

"I cant comment on my new Samsung Galaxy S20 yet... it is not yet working. 
  
  The representative that i spoke to in deciding to purchase the phone gave me inaccurate information. 
  1. The representative made clear to me that activating this unlocked phone on my Verizon account needed only that i take the sim card from my old phone and put it in my new phone. I VERY SPECFICALLY let him know that i was upgrading from a Galaxy S5. He told me it should work. 
  
  The Sim card from the S5 does not fit in the sim card slot of the S20. 
  The Best buy rep was... 
  a) uninformed
  b) dishonest (wanted me to just buy the phone)
  c) not paying attention
  
  Take your pick... in the end I am just now ordering a new sim card from verizon, which he told me i would not need. 
  
  2. Samsung Smart Switch - I asked the rep if the phone included a [Samsung OTG Micro - USB to USB Adapter]. He said clearly that YES... it is included... Alas... NO... it is NOT included.

  Weak microphone: from first day, people have complained of having trouble hearing me speak. With Covid, I was moving constantly for 2 months and was unable to return the phone but would have done so in normal times.

I thought I was upgrading from the S9+ but it feels more like a downgrade. I received mine with $400 then sold my old phone to another website for another $214. So that took some of the cost down. After setting up service found out 5G is in very select places none of which I go to. I had great internet and 3 bars but now I have mediocre internet and 2 bars. If I didn't get it at a discount in hopes that sometime in the future I'll get better service than I wouldn't be keeping it. I don't like the finger print scanner. Its worse than the S9. Its in a bad place. The close/open tab on the side is right where I place my hands so I'm constantly closing the phone.,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Motorola missed the mark. The build quality of this phone and price puts it in the same class as decent mid-range device. With no VoLTE support using both a T-Mobile and AT&T post paid SIM, this is a crippled device. ZERO help from Lenovo/Motorola. Since Lenovo bought Motorola Mobility, the customer support has gone by the wayside. 
  
  Neither AT&T or T-Mobile officially support the device, but both provider level 2 tech support state the SIMs are properly provisioned for VoLTE, and the Motorola One updated to Pie which supposedly supports VoLTE, but all calls drop to the legacy HSPA mode. Attempts to get help from Lenovo/Motorola were a waste of time. Even posted questions on their forums and no response from anyone at Lenovo. 
  
  Battery life is also poor. Drains the battery in standby overnight with no apps running or installed down 50 percent. Returned it and bought a Galaxy S8+ unlocked and works perfectly out of the box with full network support and the battery lasts days even with moderate use.

"I upgraded from my Note 9 to this (since my lease ends). My hand is average size. 
  
  Buying Decision:
  -----------------------
  S20 Ultra was too big and way out of my budget. 
  
  Debate was between S20+ and S20. I liked the smaller form factor of the S20, comfortable to hold one handed. Main differences between S20 and S20+:
  - Display Size : I was happy with S20 size
  - Battery : 4000mAh is good enough through a normal day
  - TOF sensor: I never noticed a difference in live focus when I tested. I don't use live focus anyways as its not perfect yet. 
  
  
  What I think so far
  -------------------------
  
  1. 120hz is smooth
  
  2. Better phone for small hands. I am still having difficulties typing coming from Note 9 though :). May be taking time to get used to
  
  3. If you want no-loss photo the reality is 3x zoom, more than that you lose quality considerably. 
  
  4. Enjoying the wide angle camera. 
  
  5. Punch hole still bothers me a bit, if I had owned my Note 9, probably would have waited another year for the under display selfie camera (I hope so)
  
  6. Pro video mode is awesome 
  
  7. Video Stabilization is not great
  
  8. In display finger print scanner can be improved 
  
  9. I miss headphone jack. 
  
  10. Samsung made right decision to go easy on the curve :)
  
  11. 5G is not quite there
  
  
  Overall I reckon S20 and S20+ are the go to S20 series. Size should be the main deciding factor. If you plan to buy now, I would recommend to wait to see what One plus 8 has to offer.",1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

"I wanted to love this phone. The size is perfect (phones are too big these days! It is fast, it supports low and mid band 5G (no MM wave). Signal strength was WAY better than my iPhone every I went. The screen is amazing and camera pictures are better than my iPhone as well. 
  
  I ended up returning it because I could barely get through a day on battery. I wouldn't bother with 120hz if you want to make it though a day. At 60hz it is much better but I leave the house at 530 am, I had to charge it as soon as I got home if I wanted it to last through to bedtime. 
  
  If you leave the house at 9am you might be gtg but for early risers, you either need to charge it mid day or look for the bigger models with better batteries.

"I'm sorry, but I can't comprehend these five-star reviews. Let me put this phone into a digestible snippet for you:
  
  1) It's very heavy! Like, more so than ANY other phone I've owned. So heavy that you can't even put this thing in your jeans or shorts without it dragging them down. (I carried this in the front pocket of my favorite sleep shorts and almost caused a disturbance at Publix.) 
  
  2) Contrast. OMG. They have turned up the contrast levels so much on this thing that it becomes impossible to ignore! Scrolling through FB, every image is just bursting out at you in a skewed Willy Wonka fashion. You can't even look at the news without each and every image blasting you in the face. 
  
  3) The camera. Speaking of contrast...if you prefer taking pictures and having them look NOTHING like they do in real life, then THIS is the phone for you! I took multiple side-by-side pics with this phone and my old Google Pixel 2XL and the difference was day and night (or, as this phone's camera would say, 'super bright yellow and blinding white.'"" What, I assume, they were trying to do with this phone was ""punch up"" all your pictures so you can share them instantly without editing.

"Coming from the iPhone X to this phone is a real delight. My first favorite thing about this phone is SPEED! From 5G to the 120 hertz screen it is so refreshing. In addition I was feeling limited on iPhone from just the simple fact that Apple apps are the default. 
  
  The first thing I changed from a ease of use stand point for my self is enable gestures for home, back, and multitasking. The fingerprint scanner is so nice to have with COVID requiring everyone to wear a mask that makes faceID useless. A couple of years ago I couldn't say that my Android was as smooth as an iPhone. Now I have to say hands down the S20 has my iPhone beat in smoothness on the OS side to opening apps. 
  
  Customization is so nice to have as well. I love being able to tell google ""Play music"" and instead of playing apple music it plays Spotify. Or if a friend sends you a text with a link to a website it will open Chrome, Firefox or any browser I set it to! 
  
  I own a car with Apple Carplay and Android Auto. After using Android Auto coming from Apple Carplay Android Auto is just better. Google Maps is your default search for addresses. Which is nice.

The included charger is crazy fast I would say less than an hour for all the battery, but I prefer the fast wireless charge that is slower but feels more practical. 
  
  My only complain about the phone is the on screen fingerprint sensor that is awfull imprecise, you need to put your finger on the right spot and the fight angle if you want to make it work, I really prefer physical fingerprint scanner that in my experience was always flawless and fast.

"I bought this for my wife recently since we were going on our own cell phone plan. We got the unlocked model incase we wanted to switch carriers. She loves it. It is a big improvement over the Samsung Galaxy A10 that she had before. The camera quality is very good , if not exceptional compared to the S9 which I currently have. I will eventually upgrade to this phone for myself when I can afford it. I played around with it and I notice there was no preinstalled carrier bloatware which was very nice (unlocked). I am sure the other ones that are carrier locked come with that stuff. 
  
  After playing around with the phone, it has a very similar feel to the S9 and S10. Volume buttons are placed on the same side as the power button, which is hard to get used to that. Setting up the fingerprint reader is pretty easy, only thing is if you have a crappy screen protector, it may interfere with that. Its very fast, start up time is quick. I am sure there are other features of the phone I have yet to discover, I will find those over time. 
  
  The only down side I see is that this does not have a headphone jack. I am not going to dock it point for that for that. Most phone manufacturers are going away with the 3.5mm jack (sadly). The headphones that come with use the USB-C connection where you charge your phone. Since this phone has better battery life, I suppose you would not need to use the charger as often when using headphones, but that would depend on the user. 
  
  The headphones are pretty good with sound quality. They are not bad, not the worst I have used. All in all, an excellent phone that I would highly recommend.",1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Let me start off by saying that I'm no power user/mobile gamer. I use this phone to listen to podcasts on the road, check social medias, and do normal phone things like call people. The speakers are surprisingly good after hearing those of the other phones in this price range. Screen is nice, clear and bright when needed. Cellular antenna is average. The phone (after a few weeks of use) hasnt locked up on me, and shows no signs of slowing down. To keep it short, this phone does everything it should, and everything I need it to. My one real complaint would be the battery. It's a shame to have a phone this well made and still have a sub 4k mAh lithium battery. It does run through about 4 hours of youtube/video play without charge, and I can still go at least a day of regular use, but I know this could become quite miserable to use in the future now with the lack of changeable batteries. All in all, if I had to score it, I'd give this phone an 8.5/10.",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

"So for the last 10 years, I have been mostly an Apple user. However, my work phone has always been an Android. And I've always liked Android phones. My current work phone is a Galaxy note 9. And I like it. I decided I wanted to make a switch for my personal phone. However I did not want to buy a Galaxy note 9 as they are expensive. The employee in the store help me narrow down my choices and I decided to go with the Motorola One. 
  This phone is extremely beautiful. Has a iPhone X type of look. The first time I held it, I was really impressed with how easy it was to hold. I'm used to having to use both hands to hold a phone. So it was very refreshing to only have one hand to use this phone. The build quality is nice. It does not feel cheap at all. I have seen people complain about battery life, however, I have not seen issues with battery. I charge it overnight and wake up and go on with my day and by the end of the work day I still have about 40% left. So I am not sure what others are doing but I don't have that problem. I also like that it has expanded storage. I did buy an microSD card to upgrade my storage. 
  day-to-day performance is pretty decent. The reason why I gave four stars instead of 5, is that it does lag just a small bit when playing a game like words with Friends. Sometimes it's a little laggy when sending a text message, but not enough to irritate me. 
  call quality seems to be awesome. I have not had any calls drop. Crystal clear sound. The speaker is nice. The camera is a bit finicky. The selfie mode does it take the best pictures in the world. Definitely not good pictures in low-light. The rear camera is really nice. 
  overall, I would recommend this phone. If you want a nice unlocked phone at a pretty affordable price, this phone is really a good way to go. Motorola really upped their game with this device.",1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
"Upgrading from an S7 Edge, I can say that this phone is absolutely fantastic. I went for Cloud Blue and I was not disappointed with how this phone looked because it looks stunning. This phone has an absolutely beautiful 6.1 inch display which ought to be large enough for most people. Performance is snappy--I can say I rarely, if not never, experience slow downs on this phone. The 120 HZ refresh rate, while it does lower battery life, is so smooth that it is hard to pass up. Speaking of battery life, the battery can last two days which is good for me considering the fact that I use my phone relatively frequently throughout a day. The camera quality is fantastic and has many cool options--some of them being niche, admittedly, but still cool. Of course, being Android, you get a lot of customization features which I have been utilizing. You can really do what you want to this phone.

"I've tried a lot of phones in 2019/2020 and this one fits my needs perfectly. It's my favorite. 
  
  1. I have big hands but I'm sick of the overly large phones. This one is the perfect size for me and my pocket. 
  2. Love the power in this phone, 12gb of ram with the 865 is potent. 
  3. Because it's smaller, this screen is super crisp. 563 ppi ...enough said and with the 120htz refresh rate, clean experience. 
  4. Battery life is excellent for me. I've been around android phones so long I know all the battery saving tips. I don't need 5g with as fast as this phone is already so disabling it increases my battery life tremendously. Plus I don't play games on my phone or have a million notifications enabled. I use my phone a lot and I can stay off the charger from the time i wake up until I hit the pillow again at night (7am-11pm). 
  5. I found this phone open box and it was still new with untouched accessories, even still had the plastic on the phone for $600 ($400 savings). Winning.

"If you want a top tier flagship, don't stop here. 
  BUT if you want a budget phone that can kick butt, take great pictures, and last all day? This. 
  Google's software makes this phone feel so much more than it is. It isn't the biggest baddest phone, it fits nicely in my smallish hands and is a big upgrade over my 2yr old phone. 
  I've gone back and forth between Samsung and Pixel devices since the first Pixel and I have to say, this is by far the happiest I've been with a new phone in a very long time. I've felt cheated out of money, disappointed after a few days with the new bells and whistles, and left wanting with battery life but not with this phone. I hope none of that changes. 
  Plus, I have this phone on Google Fi and my normally barely there service from a big company that claims best service has been absolutely blown out of the water. I can now make phone calls from inside of my house!!",0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1

"Purchased for my daughter. She loved her old phone and had it for 5 years with NO interest in ever replacing it; but it died. So, we were forced to shop. I HATE, HATE, HATE shopping for cell phones and she was even less enthusiastic about it! We chose the GOOGLE Pixel 5. Guess what-she LOVES it! She’s been having all kinds of fun learning and playing with all its features. Yay was so fun when showing us products and Jace was invaluable in helping her get the new phone set up on her existing cell phone plan.

They never fixed them. 
  
  Outside of that the phone is ok. It's a decent size for single hand use. It's a medium size screen and the display is of decent quality. Its fast enough with slight delays in processing pictures or video. They omitted the neural core which helped previous models.

"I have been using Pixel Phones since the original came out. Some people may get caught up in the fact that this phone does not offer the highest-end 2020 CPU as Samsung or others do. I am here to tell you that Google does the best job in the industry in optimizing their phones and the user experience is fantastic without the high-end CPU. This keeps the cost of the phone down and much more reasonable than Samsung or Apple. Below are the highlights. 
  
  - Fantastic Camera as always with Pixel Devices
  - Battery life is amazing. Lasting two days under some circumstances. 
  - 5G connectivity
  - Size of the phone enables single-hand use
  - Fingerprint reader where it should be. No stupid face unlock. 
  - 3 Years of promised updates from Google
  - This model is unlocked. Use it with any carrier
  - Price is amazing compared to Apple or Samsung flagship offerings
  
  Cons:
  -The stereo speakers are not as good as the stereo speaker with the competition. But not bad either. 
  - Fast charging is nice, but not nearly as fast as some of the competitors. 
  
  If you are looking for a ""flagship phone"" without some of the meaningless features that Samsung and Apple want to make you THINK you need, then this phone is for you. The price is perfect versus the competition and Google's 3 years of monthly update support will not be matched by Samsung or Apple, I can promise you that.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1

"Sooooooo I've been wanting a pixel since the pixel 3 but never made the jump because I've been a dedicated iphone guy since the iphone 4. I had the iphone x and didn't see the hype on the new iphone for $1200. I'm not a video editor or a professional protographer. I don't need the best phone out there. Anyways I bought a he dang pixel 5 and I couldnt have been happier. It doesnt really feel like android. It's very similar to iphone in regards to thumb gestures keyboard etc. The best thing about this phone are all the little features exclusive to the pixel. phone screening, google assistant holds for you calls, you'll find them if you get the phone. Ive had this phone for 14 days and only 1 issue. When texting my wife who has iphone her texts weren't coming threw. Restarted the phone and no issues since. I really recommend this phone especially at the price point. You have all the great features you want. 90hz screen great battery sleek design AMAZING camera. And the biggest thing for me was the weight difference from the iphone it's like a feather!! Just buy it. Guarantee you will fall in love

"The size is right, the battery is great with Extreme Battery Saver and 3 years of android updates should be a minimum of what Google gives for a $700 phone. 
  Unfortunately, this phone is not a good 5G alternative with plenty of other 5G phones for the same cost with better specs. 
  More importantly, Sub-6 5G is only a little faster than 4G LTE and mmWave is only in certain cities under a mmWave antenna. So if you live in a city where mmWave has been established by a carrier then great. If you rely on T-Mobile, Google Fi, or US Cellular then you'll be waiting for mmWave (the UBER fast 5G) to be turned on at your location. Why do you think Verizon is now selling home 5G? Answer: their 5G is not available unless you live in a city where they've installed it, and big venues like stadiums... 
  I don't knock the phone because it is good but if you NEED a new phone, not WANT a new phone then buy cheap like the Pixel 4a 5G at $150 less, the same phone with a 3.5 headphone jack. If you need a bigger phone then go Samsung since they've really stepped up their Android Update game. 
  Again, I'm not knocking the Pixel line, I own a Pixel 4 and wanted to try the 5G line and can confirm with other reviews here and elsewhere if you do your homework you'll find that the speeds for Sub-6 (slow 5G) that goes through walls is not much faster then what you currently receive without a 5G phone. Don't let all the hype be phone company's or providers fool you. 
  Then there's the reported gap in the screen that many people are noticing. Gap in a screen? sounds like a production issue we've all heard of with other phone companies? 
  
  I would recommend this phone to a friend but only if they lived under a 5G mmWave tower or spent the majority of their day in a 5G mmWave city working and what not...",0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

"Google - Pixel 5 5G 128GB (Unlocked) - Just Black
  The Google Pixel 5 with 5G is an interesting phone. The black aluminum body looks and feels very good in the hand. I really like the simple layout of just a power and volume button. The display is OLED and is able to use a 90Hz screen refresh rate. It’s a 6” 1080p screen with HDR10+ and looks crisp and sharp. I found the screen to have very nice colors out of the box. I also like that it supports the always on screen. The phone uses a Qualcomm 765 Snapdragon which isn’t the fastest chip out today but I never found it to lack in my usage. I don’t play mobile games so that might be a consideration. The phone comes with 128GB of local storage and 8GB of ram and it is IP68 dust/water resistant. The phone supports Bluetooth 5.0 with aptX HD support so if you have this aptX support in your Bluetooth headphone you will get very high quality music. I do wish Google supported SD cards with their phones but this was dropped long ago. The phone has stereo speakers on the bottom and they did sound very good. This was also true for incoming and outgoing calls. The back fingerprint reader was easy to setup and is very fast in use. The phone supports fast wireless and wired charging including reverse charging in the event you ever need to top off another device. As is the case with Google phones the picture quality is excellent and includes an ultrawide lens. The phone supports video recording up to 4k@60fps and 1080p up to 240fps. The camera does an excellent job in most any lighting condition. The phone comes out of the box with Android 11 and the October 2020 security update. As is typical with Google phones this is pure Android at its finest and is a pleasure to use. In my testing as seen in the attached image T-Mobile 5G service is all over the map in my local area. On one street I could match my home cable connection, on the next it was no better than 4G. The quality of the 5G was directly related to the signal strength. Where it was strongest the speeds and ping were good enough to replace my home cable service. If only the signal was more stable. This might not be due to the Pixel since this is the first 5G phone I have been able to test. Verizon has a different type of 5G then T-Mobile so the results could be very different. My take is when buying a new phone today, having 5G is a good idea but I would not let it be my primary reason to choose one phone over another. However as more 5G service is built out I would hope the stability also improves. I do like the Pixel 5. I really like it's camera and clean Android. The 5G is still a question to me but I am glad it's here. The new phones available give you lots of choices. I am not sure Google has enough here to make the case that their phone is better than the competition. This is also true now that Samsung has announced 3 years of support for their current phones. This was one of the primary reasons to choose a Google phone. The Pixel 5 is a very nice phone and I enjoy it but I find it hard to make it a solid recommendation with the other options that are available.",1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1

"I recently took my Pixel 3 on a trip to visit family and at the gas...it fell out of my lap, the screen cracked fully in the middle and the corners were busted. I took it to a repair shop and got quoted $290.00 for both screen and USB port replacement. I am good...at that cost it was a no brainier. Look up and realize that there was a Best Buy store across the street. Walked in and walked out with a new Pixel 5 in my hand. 
  
  The Pixel 5 solved a lot of the issues that was plaguing the Pixel 3 and dealt with the battery issue that Google purposely did with the Pixel 4. There is just something about a Pixel phone that is hard to describe that my parents describe the way they use their iPhone. The thing is the phone works and it works well! I wasn't expecting the phone to keep up with my Pixel 3 in terms of performance but difference between having 8gbs and 3gbs of memory sureade the difference. Now instead of lagging right away when I have at least 5 or 7 apps open. That issue is no more. I've been using up to 10+ apps without knowing only to realize it when I'm closing them. My biggest purchase for the Pixel 5 is for my every day phone and of course the pictures. Everyone including myself knows that the pictures that comes out of the Pixel is usually a sure hit regardless of the model. The Pixel 5 ensured this by me testing several shots while on a camping trip and wow. The pictures are overall very pleasant and lovely. Initially I was a bit worried for action shots because with all of the update that my Pixel 3 was getting, the camera app definitely lagged quite a bit. It was usable but I wanted with certainty that this was a no issue. The Pixel 5 turned out to be more amazing than I had imagine. I really advised people to learn some of the tricks that allows the phone to take such photos. The biggest surprised and benefits of the Pixel is when you have it setup to a tripod...make sure you have 3 second delay and have it in night mode. If you're trying to do a star shot or light painting it's always usually the same. The light painting requires you to have someone in the background with a light stick painting the person you're trying to get a photo off. Keep an eye on the Pixel screen. The results usually shows within 10 seconds. The moment you see the result, press stop. Repeat this process till you get a good trip on how to get better with your subject and the phones ability. This also works with astrophotography and human subject. I usually do it within the first 10-15 seconds or let the phone run its 3+ minute course and have the subject enter the photo the last 20-30 second. This gives the phone plenty of time to clean the image and grab as many star as possible. For the individual... make sure you slowly shine a light left to right to keep the person in the image and have that subject light up and be present in the photo. All else wise, the Pixel is a fantastic everyday phone and the battery life is such a no brainier for anyone. It's no flag ship as far as specs are compared but specs alone does not speak for a phones worth. It's fluid and smooth, my every day use has not been any issue at all! Love my phone and hopefully Pixel 6 will come out with a killer camera spec and more storage! Come on Google!",1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

"I bought and gifted my mom the very first Pixel XL when it came out about 4 years ago. That phone had been holding up pretty well until now, no complaints. I got her the 64 gb version which started to max out, so it was time for the upgrade. She loved her Pixel XL so much that she didn't want to switch to any other phone and I didn't want to give her the older generation Pixel. Fortunately, Pixel 5 came out and it was perfect timing. So I got this one for her and she just can't thank me enough. It's a big upgrade for her from Pixel 1 XL to 5 without compromising on the size (pic of both phones side by side attached for comparison). She just loves it. The only thing that she's still getting used to is the lack of three virtual buttons at the bottom that Pixel 1 XL had. It will take some time but she will get a hang of it for sure. It feels so nice to hold the phone and is very lightweight. I immediately ordered a phone cover & a screen protector as I know all modern phones are so delicate that they can break even if you just dream about dropping them. Lol. 
  
  Since my mom isn't too much into tech, I had to set the phone up for her and do the usual data transfer. Surprisingly, it gave me bit of a hard time setting up/transferring data. Not sure what the problem was. It would get stuck at one point during set up process, just would not proceed and eventually give up. I tried 3 times and put it aside after failing every time. I then tried it again after about half an hour and it worked right away. It was walk in the park after that. I finished the setup/transfer and explored the phone little bit. I will admit, it's a great phone in comparison with the other Pixel that she had. My dad has a Pixel 4 and even in comparison to that, Pixel 5 seems a lot more upgraded. The only feature missing from Pixel 5 as compared to 4 is the facial unlock feature. Really, I'm not sure why you would remove one of the best features from your phone. I read somewhere online that according to Google, it's ‘a good trade-off’ to enable other premium features. I don't know about that but I do miss that feature. Hence the reason for deducting a star. 
  
  This phone is equipped with 5G capability but I was not much excited about this feature as we don't have 5G coverage in our area but it's a good to have feature that we can use in future. It has a 90 hz display which is wonderfully smooth. The phone feels incredibly responsive and the difference between this and the Pixel 1 XL screen is very noticeable. Gives you just as much usable space as the 1 XL, but with so much less weight/bevel. Camera is also good. Every photo blows me away and the portrait mode is so good. The lack of an absolutely bleeding-edge sensor does not negatively impact the camera at all. The lack of a separate chip for processing images means that the time it takes for a picture to be visible in perfect quality after you take it is noticeable. It's not a problem at all if you're taking three or less pictures or if you're not immediately checking to see what the picture looked like, but if you're taking a bunch at once, you may occasionally find yourself getting frustrated by the seconds it takes to actually be able to flip through all the pictures. Pixel phones are among the best, if not the best, for taking photos, hence you can rest assured that it's quite easy to take awesome quality photos, without putting in much effort. The dual camera setup, features the standard wide angle & an ultra wide angle sensor. The photo editing/touching up software that comes with the phone is pretty impressive and fast, there is the ability to change the lighting and shadows in the pic after its been taken. I have not had enough time to deep dive but the few things I've tried have worked well. Fingerprint scanner is fast and accurate, a definite improvement over Pixel 1 XL. Battery life is phenomenal. Each charge seems to last about 1.5 days of regular usage. Much better than the previous phone. Wireless charging & reverse wireless charging are super convenient with metal enclosure. Again, an added feature that Pixel 1 XL didn't have. Sound quality is nice but sounds tiny to me at high volume, this is because there are no speakers built in but uses a vibration technology to play sound through the phone. I'm not talking about midrange where most people are likely to use but at full blast. 
  
  This is the best choice for a modern android phone in 2020! It has great power-efficient specs, 90 Hz display, long-lasting battery, all-screen design (no notch! ), very responsive fingerprint reader (for those who cannot use face unlock).

"Great phone, super fast and smooth operation. no issues at all. T-Mobile only sells 4a5G and not Pixel 5, was told by their store person that Pixel 5 may not get 5G on T-Mobile because it may be missing radio bands for their 5G (n25 specifically) . On the website I saw that they use n41 and n71 for 5G and will use n260 and n261 for mmWave in the future, Pixel 5 has all these bands so I checked and I get 5G icon showing up in my phone (you have to turn wifi off to see what you are connected to because wifi symbol hides 5G or LTE icon when wifi is turned on. In my experience, I do get 5G most of the time even though I live right on the edge of the coverage map where 5G ends in my area. Hopefully anyone else who has T-Mobile also can get the 5G also.

"Specs don't make a phone- this phone is a testament to that fact. Yes, there are much better hardwares from plenty of flagships this year, however the pixel 5 excels in giving you a smooth user experience and great useful features including an excellent camera. Ultrawide makes it a cut above Pixel 4a, and I found myself going to the Pixel 5 whenever my Pixel 4a couldn't capture the full frame from a short distance (in a mall for example). The screen is big enough and the android goodies baked into it makes it an absolute pleasure to use. Battery optimization is great, sound is good enough although not great. However, get pixel buds and youtube premium and it's a complete media powerhouse.

"I would say this is probably the best Android phone I've used in many ways. My favorite aspect of this is easily the design. I'm NOT talking about aesthetic/looks. I'm talking about how it FEELS in the hand and how the screen looks. It's the kind of phone you absolutely do not NEED a case for. Some might op for one to make it look better (ps don't get green; only the black looks half-decent). But you don't need it! Because of the metal frame it's sturdy, solid feeling, and you don't get scared dropping it. The texture on the back is great too. Grippy without being cheap-feeling. As far as the screen, while it may not measure up to iPhone-level colors and brightness, it makes up for it with the edge-to-edge design only interrupted by the hold-punch cutout from the selfie-cam. Cameras on this are not as good as iPhone-level but they get the job done and back-cam CAN crank out some impressive stuff with the right light. Performance isn't anything to call home about, but it's good and does the job you need it to. Battery life is really good. 
  Overall I'd say this is a great phone for someone that refuses to buy an iPhone for whatever reason (though I still recommend iPhone for most people). FAR better than any previous Pixel phone which I simply couldn't recommend. Much better than gambling with a Samsung phone.

"I""m all Apple (iMac, Airbook, Mac Pro, etc) and had an iPhone since inception (2007) and around the 5 and 6 they got progressively worse, so after a year of research I switched to the OG Google Pixel and it was THE best phone I ever owned (except for the magnitude of the OG iPhone of course). 
  
  But then after ""upgrading"" to the Pixel 3XL, I had a ton of problems, terrible battery, Android auto issues, Pixel buds issues etc. So I went back to the iPhone (11 Pro). What a mistake, Siri sucks with terrible dictation where I'm constantly fixing text messages or emails, spam calls bug me all day (they don't with the Pixel), the night camera absolutely sucks (in comparison to Google's nite site) among other things. 
  
  When I heard about the Pixel 5, I had to start my research again, and since I don't allow inferior products in my life, I bought it and all I can say is thank you Google, it is once again the best phone I've owned, with even better features, it's light and wicked fast, great battery life, amazing camera (yes at night too) superb dictation and the hands down best AI for $700.

"I can't believe I finally went with a Google Pixel... First time I heard from then was from a friend in Brazil back in 2016. He is a tech guy and said how much he wanted the Pixel 3 (top at the moment). Last year I was drawn to the Pixel 4 due to its Astronomical camera (I'm an astronomer), however money was short and my iphone X still worked fine. 
  
  My old phone screen suddenly stopped working when I was watching a video, so I decided to buy the new Pixel 5 as a Christmas treat for myself, I paid cash for an opened box which was $615, but I could tell the phone hasn't been used, someone bought it, put the SIM in it and for some reason they returned the phone, lucky me there was only one LOL. 
  
  It was love at first sight. The phone transfered all the data from my iphone (didn't know I could cross data like this on different soperatiinal systems). Af first it was kinda slow because it was installing so many apps, but as soon as it finished OMG you have no idea how high this phone can fly. The camera is just unbelievably AWESOME, I use night sight even at day time since in my opinion makes the photos so much better. The screen is so vivid, beautiful and smooth. Honestly, I am never going back to apple.

About what you expect from Google. Hardware about what you expect for the cost. Touchscreen is not very sensitive which is annoying with gloves on as it usually doesn't work. Great camera mostly due to software post processing. Rest of software is buggy as hell as one would expect from Google. Mind boggling how they've not been able to figure out screen rotation that works reliably but that's Google. One gets the feeling they really don't care all that much.,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
"The Google Pixel 5 is a great all around phone that is more budget friendly than the latest and greatest phones out there. At $650 the Pixel 5 is more appealing to budget minded people, yet the phone doesn't compromise much. I'm sure it is one of the more affordable 5G phones out there. 
  
  In the package with the phone is a 5v/3A + 9v/2A charger, USB-C cable and a USB-A to USB-C adapter. The adapter and USB cable are used for transferring files and settings from your old device to the Pixel. This worked surprisingly well. One note, since my old phone had a USB-C port also I thought I could just connect the two phones with the included cable and transfer that way. However the phones didn't recognize each other. Instead, when I used the A to C adapter with a different USB-A to USB-C cable, the phones recognized each other and the transfer was made. There must be some sort of circuitry in the adapter that makes the transfer possible. 
  
  The screen is fantastic. I love that the phone is so thin and the screen goes right up to the edges. The screen is slightly larger than my old phone, but slightly smaller in overall size. 
  
  Swiping, motions and tasks operate smoothly. The processor is actually a step down in processing speed from many newer phones, but you'll never notice the difference and everything works as it should. 
  
  For the camera, Google opted for a two lens system that is more suited to wider shots than ""zooming in"". The camera and video camera work very well, even in low light conditions, but don't expect to zoom in and get good photos. There is noticeable noise when zooming 2x. Having said that, the camera works well close up. 
  
  4K video at 60fps? Pretty amazing. I'm not a videophile but the features of the camera are great and work well. I enjoy taking panorama shots and those look great. There are options for taking slo-mo and time lapse video that also worked great. I'm pretty happy with the image and video performance of this phone. 
  
  Minor annoyances:
  Google did away with facial recognition unlock. At first I was rather annoyed by this as I've become accustomed to unlocking my phone this way, but the fingerprint scanner works really well and is located on the back of the phone so that as soon as I pick up the phone and tap the fingerprint scanner it instantly unlocks. 
  Also, there is no LED indicator light for notifications. Notifications will pop up on the screen but only for a few seconds so if I miss that notification I have no way of knowing about those notifications unless I unlock the phone. Also, there's no way to increase the time the notifications stay visible on the lock screen. I wish I could change that. 
  
  Overall I'm very happy with the Google Pixel 5.",1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

"I upgraded from a pixel 3 to this phone and it feels like a huge upgrade. There's only two noticable downgrade - the front camera and the speakers - but I don't take a ton of selfies so it wasn't a deal breaker for me and I never listen to music on my phone speakers. 
  
  There's a lot to love about this phone. The battery is impressively good, I regularly get between 7.5 to 8.5 of screen on time. The cameras take nice pictures as you'd expect, the bezel-less display looks much more modern than my pixel 3. I love the textured rubber on the back of the phone, no case needed! Then the nice things like the 5G, 90 Hz display, and reverse wireless charging. I notice that the phone is much better at multitasking too, probably thanks to the extra RAM this phone is running. The addition of a wide angle camera is great too! You can fake digital zoom, but not wide angle. 
  
  Now for the noticable downgrades from the pixel 3. The front camera is less sharp than the camera on the pixel 3 and there's only one, rather than the wide angle plus normal selfie camera. It's also a fixed focal length rather than autofocusing which makes pictures appear much more soft. But this isn't a big deal, the selfie camera isn't anywhere as important as the main cameras. The lack of stereo speakers are also a disappointment, but not a deal breaker again since I'd rather have an edge to edge display than slightly better phone speakers.",1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

We ordered a screen, and it was correct. We took the shipment to the local store and discovered discrepancies. Milton Smith went out of his way to make things ""right"" for us. When he tried ordering the correct case, we saw where the stores provisioning system had data entry errors. Milton was attentive, understanding, efficient, and exhausted all possibilities to right the wrongs. Without him, Best Buy would have received a ""D-"" in our eyes.

"The Google Pixel 5 has a sleek design, extremely long lasting battery life, and feels great in the palm of my hand. It's very lightweight but still solid. The OLED display is absolutely gorgeous, and I'm able to see everything clearly even when in sunny areas outside.

Great little phone. But a different one than your used to. I like this little phone but Google took away too many features for its price. The battery will last you all day. Speakers are ok but a step down from what we are used to. The plastic over the metal body feels nice but lacks that cool to touch feeling. I feel google made the right call in making it cheaper because its 2020 but I think everyone should wait until the next one or the rumored Pixel 5 pro,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The Pixel 5 is a really really nice phone. Fast, good battery life, zero lag, awesome camera, and the ""smooth display"" feature makes a really noticable difference. Also, the build feels really sturdy and you may not need a case of you only use them to protect from scratches and scuffs. 
  
  The only probablem I had was the price compared to competition. There are two nearly identical Pixels out right now, the 4a and 4a 5G for a much better price. They are both missing different features - but 5g isn't too important right now, and unless you've had a fast/smooth display you won't know what you're missing out on yet.

"I’ve been using a Samsung S20 Ultra for almost a year now and the one main thing that I don’t like about the phone is that it’s huge, I mean huge “as phones go” and decided I wanted a smaller, more economical phone that would fit my budget “way overspent on the Ultra”, and when I saw Google was coming out with the Pixel 5 I had to give it a shot. 
  
  Unboxing:
  The Pixel came in a nice company logoed box, and inside was the Pixel, Charger, USB Cable, USB to USB C adapter, sim card tray ejector tool and paperwork, “no headphones are included. The screen was covered with a protective opaque plastic film, “there’s no factory screen protector installed”. 
  
  Initial Impressions:
  I was “am” amazed at the size of this Pixel, it’s so small compared to the Ultra but still has a 6” screen. There are barely any borders around it and the top, bottom and sides are all uniform this time, nothing uneven here. Turning around the back is a textured finish that I really like, sort of a very very fine sand paper feel to it, “think 3000 grit” which also makes it very grippy, “I still put all my phones in a case though”. There’s a dual camera setup and the rear fingerprint sensor makes a comeback. The right side has the power button “top” volume controls below it, and then the SIM tray is on the opposite side. On top there is a microphone hole, and the bottom has two slits for the speaker/microphone and a USB C port. 
  
  Setting up:
  The first thing I did after unboxing was to charge the phone, “arrived at 75% full”, I then began the setup procedure after installing the sim I had taken out of the Ultra, “we use Mint Mobile here”. it has the normal Android setup so if you’ve set up an android phone you’ll pretty much know how that works. 
  
  During the setup it asked if I wanted to transfer everything from my old phone so I went ahead and that that by connecting both together with the dual USB C ended cable that came with the Pixel. This process made it very simple to bring all my apps over from my old phone “and most of my settings”. Also depending on your carrier you may have to set up the APN for that carrier and that information is found on their website. 
  
  Use:
  Now that everything was transferred and setup to my liking I made some test calls. Due to me having hearing problems I always have to use a headset to hear properly, but I was actually surprised that I could hear pretty good without the headset, not perfect but good enough for a quick call. I set up the multiple Bluetooth headsets I keep around and I was very surprised that all the headsets actually sounded better than the Ultra, and callers on the other end said they could hear me clearly, so that’s pass for calling. The Bluetooth distance was similar to the Ultra with all the headsets and I really didn’t notice a difference there. 
  
  Luckily Mint here in W Phoenix supports 5g and the Pixel connected to that immediately on channel 66, “the Ultra connects on the same channel”. I ran a few speed tests on each one for both Wi-Fi and 5G and the results surprised me. The Ultra on band 66 was getting -106db for signal strength, with an average of 24.3Mbps down and 3.59Mbps up. On Wi-Fi the Ultra got 144Mbps down and 10.51Mbps up “our internet speed here at home is capped at 150Mbps”. Now for the Pixel 5, “also on band 66, sitting in the same location in our home office”, it was getting -108db for signal strength with an average of 33.3Mbps down and 7.57Mbps up. With Wi-Fi the Pixel 5 got 144Mbps down and 10.2Mbps up. These numbers sort of surprised me as I ran multiple tests on each phone and the Pixel 5 on 5G beat the Ultra, and was almost identical using Wi-Fi. The doubling of upload speed is what really got me. 
  I didn't test any other bands as 5g connects and works fine around this area. 
  
  Camera:
  I haven’t used the camera a lot, but from the pictures I’ve taken they are really good for a cell phone and does keep the Pixel reputation as one of the best phone cameras. Would I say it’s as good as the Ultra? , well the regular cameras pictures look every bit as good, and the night shot pictures look better. There’s no optical zoom with the Pixel so I really can’t compare it to the zoom on the Ultra “but there’s also a big price difference between the two”. The wide angle lens may be a little less than the Ultras but looking at shots taken from both on the screen they both look really good. 
  
  Short videos I’ve taken look really good and I mainly shoot at 1080p as 4k just takes up too much room. The slow motion and time lapse settings work really well and are very comparable to the Ultra “just in a lot smaller package. I do have a GoPro if I want to shoot a lot of 4k video so I don’t shoot a lot of videos with a phone anyway. 
  
  Conclusion:
  I really wanted a smaller phone as I was tired of lugging around the huge one and was always afraid I was going to drop it, especially when attempting one handed use. The Pixel 5 is a good bit smaller and I have no problem using it one handed and don’t worry as much about dropping it, “especially with a metal back “only the screen is vulnerable and I'm putting a glass screen protector on it. 
  
  The screen is plenty bright and the added 90mhz refresh rate really helps when scrolling through a webpage or text. Battery life is great and where the Pixel really shines, the first day I fully charged it, set it up, installed apps, took test photos, ran multiple speed tests and still had over 40% that night. 95% of the time I use a wireless charger and that option works perfectly. 
  
  Phone call quality is outstanding, and the phone with Mint does support Wi-Fi calling without any problems. Signal strength were we are located with 5g is comparable to the S20 Ultra, and data speeds were surprisingly stronger. 
  
  The Pixel 5 is a great mid-range phone, it’s a much cheaper option that the high end phones of other manufacturers and if you don’t want to spend that much on a phone than you should be very happy with the Pixel 5",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1

In other words I'm not a noob to working cell phones and am reasonably tech savy; I build computers, do some programming in Linux, etc. This Pixel 5 is simply a nightmare of a phone.

"I absolutely love this phone... Also I've only had this phone for about a week. I will update this review if anything changes. 
  
  It's a great looking phone. I love the texture on the back of the phone. It's like what reviewers on YouTube say: it feels like stone. I wouldn't say it feels like some crude stone that you would find out on a hike or something. It feels like a fancy, smooth stone that you would buy to decorate your home. I've been at home most of the time so this phone has been without a case. I actually prefer it without it. 
  
  Form factor is much smaller than a lot of phones, but the screen makes up a large portion of it due to the small, uniform bezels. I liked the screen
  
  The phone is really fast imo. I've never used anything else that has a better processor (Samsung S20, Pixel 4, etc.) so I don't have anything to compare it to other than my Nexus 6P. I haven't encountered any lag, especially in games. I usually don't play games on the phone, but I wanted to test its power. I played Gwent on the Pixel 5, and it was as smooth as butter. The battery life is phenomenal. I had about a little over 6 hours of screen time one day and there was still above 30% left. About 2/3 of 4/5 of that screen time was attributed to Gwent. 
  
  Stock Android feels cleaner than ever. I've been stuck on Android 8 for the past 4 years so this definitely feels like a major upgrade for me. There's so many new features, but to name a few that I use A LOT are Bedtime Mode and Focus Mode for sleeping and studying, respectively. 
  
  There were quite a lot of complaints on the sound of the Pixel 5. I'm not sure how well it works in places with a lot of noise since I've been home most of the time. In my opinion, I think the sound is between good, but it's not excellent. I would consider my Nexus 6P to have excellent sound quality because there were grills and a dedicated space for my speakers. By no means though, is the Pixel 5 sound horrible. I think there's a bit of a over exaggeration on the sound being bad. I don't mind I only use the speakers most of the time for watching shows or videos (and talking to people on the phone); it works well for all those. If you listen to music on your phone a lot through the phone speaker, then maybe it might not be to your quality. The audio sounds less punchier than my Nexus 6P which has great sound, but it still sounds alright. It's not a deal breaker for me because it sounds decent enough (also I use headphones or earphones to listen to music).",0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

"Got this phone on a whim as my other one was a few years old. I have been surprised by some features and let down on others. Here is my breakdown. 
  Likes:
  Battery life is incredible. I have gone 2 days with wifi, location, and bluetooth running 24/7. The battery modes are a godsend. 
  High rez screen with excellent color and speed. 
  Screen refresh is a game changer with 90hz refresh that makes videos so smooth to watch. 
  Loud system sounds, which is good for me, as I mostly have it in my pocket at work. 
  Strong vibration on silent mode. 
  Icons can be changed to your liking (themes to be more exact). 
  Smaller size is more comfortable to carry in pocket ( mine other phone is a XL sized one)
  Camera is same as previous versions of Pixel, but the added lens and night time mode makes it much better for daily use. 
  Case is slightly textured already, so holding it is easier. 
  Metal body with rear cutout (you can't see it) for wireless charging. 
  Reverse charging is epic, With the ability to charge my headphones in case they need it but setting them on top of phone. 
  Google OS 11 is a wonder to behold with all the added features and tweaks for this phone to use. 
  Dislikes:
  Although it is a small body phone, it is not easily useable as a single handed phone. 
  New OS takes the home, back and running program listing off the bottom part of display and you have to use a gesture to use them. You can change this is the settings, but until you do, just be prepared for some frustration. 
  No headphone jack ( I like them, some don't)
  Speaker is not at top exacly, but under the glass. Which is fine for some, but I keep trying to get nearer to the speaker when I am talking to someone. 
  Speaker (2) not being at top and under the glass, lets everyone in the close area around you hear your calls. 
  Text size is to vast in difference to be good. I had a hard time reading under the normal setting and used medium. It works until you go into something like messages and then it is way too big. Can't find a happy in between. 
  Sides are too sensitive. so if you are playing a game and touch the sides, it will pause the game, or close it. 
  Side squeeze to activate assistant is gone. 
  Case is needed. Otherwise you might not be able to hold phone to ear without the possibility of dropping it . 
  When screen shot is activated, it will minimize the screen and take a picture. However, it will also cut off the bottom portion where the screen capture option is. Thus not capturing the whole page or picture. 
  
  I am glad I got the phone for many reasons. However I am tempted to go back to my older phone since I had all the settings the way I liked them and it was easier to hold.",1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

I expect it to be pretty good for the first month or two but it's really, really fantastic. I like the textured back, and the camera isn't just good, it's fast. It seems to do a good job of connecting to 5G in my area but honestly my data needs are pretty modest, I might turn it off if it's better for the battery. 
  
  Once change in Android, swapping the virtual buttons for gestures, I thought I was going to hate, but I absolutely love. Really there's only three gestures, for home, back and active apps, and they're very easy to remember and use, and they work 100% consistently. That's one of my biggest iOS gripes, that back isn't consistent between applications, and sometimes works differently within the same application (I'm looking at you, Facebook).

"I'll be upfront: I am not a phone power user. I watch a ton of youtube, browse the internet while pooping, and maybe get suckered once or twice a year with a ""free"" game. 
  
  I bought this phone because I had a pixel 2 that finally started to get battery issues. I really like stock Android over the Samsung shell and I've never had an LG, OnePlus, etc. 
  
  As for the pros, the upgrade was seamless. Swap sim, download apps, profit. The battery life has this far been incredible. 1 full day is all I hope for with a phone. I listen to spotify or podcasts for 8-10 hrs a day a work, the occasional phone call, some texts, email, and a few videos. Somehow this guy gets a day and a half. For my needs, this is the selling feature. I don't always have access to a charger and the longer I can get, the better. It's waterproof and initially durable as it still works after being dropped in a pot hole puddle. Screen looks fine as mobile youtube has never looked better. My pictures of spreadsheets have never been so clear. The size is also remarkably close to the pixel 2 so many accessories and cradles have been compatible. 
  
  The cons: With a bezeless screen, it's harder for me to one handed type. The front facing camera, while not a notch, is still noticeable and sometimes makes my brain think there is something on the screen. With the screen being slightly larger, it's harder to high score frantic tapper games. 
  
  If you're after an ol' reliable and are coming from an older phone, this is a great product. The battery life is stupid good, and it does everything else a normie might want to do. The price point is acceptable to me because I know what I'm getting. You won't wow your friends and you'll still be the awkward color bubble in imessage, but get past that and this looks like a phone I keep for another 3 years.",1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

  The 90hz screen is very smooth and it just makes the phone feel more responsive overall which is a HUGE plus. 90hz should be standard going forward. 
  
  The color is a little washed out compared to that of the Pixel 2 I had, but I got over it quickly.

"Great phone, but should have been priced lower for specs considering most features are the same on the Pixel 4a 5G, which is sold for a lot less (and adds back in a headphone jack too). 
  
  Great phone overall, but for the asking price, and considering that the CPU is slower than last years Pixel 4, this should have been priced lower. Don’t get me wrong, for most people the CPU on this Pixel 5, is very solid, and most people will not notice a difference, especially if they do not play android games. While I am a big gamer, android games themselves are not for me. They do not compare to console game experiences. Luckily we now have Xbox Game Pass on Android which are cloud based streaming game services. I can report that the Google Pixel 5 works and fits the Razer Kishi controller perfectly for those that might be wondering. 
  
  I am coming from a nearly 3 year old LG v30 phone, and the Pixel 5 is just way snappier, no doubt due to it having double the amount of RAM, Pixel 5 has 8gb of RAM. I have noticed no lag switching between various apps, and have not even rebooted the phone in the more than 6 days I have been using this phone. While the CPU is a bit slower than other phones in this price-range, it seems Google has done this to conserve battery power. And let me tell you this is the best phone I have owned, ever, in terms of battery power. I can start the day at 100 percent battery charge, and use the phone for calls, texting, even watching videos on youtube, and streaming, and 8 hours later, still have over 50 percent battery life. There is no headphone jack on this phone, but luckily, this phone has Bluetooth 5.0, and defaults to using the excellent quality AptX audio codec if you headphones support it. I also noticed that the bluetooth range with this device is so much better than my LG v30 ever was. With my LG v30, all my smartwatch would always disconnect if I went anywhere more than about 20 feet away from my phone, same with any bluetooth headphones. I now can go more than double that range with my smartwatch. 
  
  Probably the best thing about this phone. The operating system!! NO BLOAT!! Pure android 11. This is probably the best version of Android I have seen. Way better than LG and Samsung. Those phones try to do too much, and in the process slow your phone down in my experience. Android 11 will take a little getting used to, it took me a good day to get used to using what they call “gestures”, getting away from using “virtual buttons” like other manufacturers have been doing in the past. The OS is just plain SNAPPY and RESPONSIVE!! Even though it might have a slower CPU than other phones in this price range, you would never know it switching between apps, etc. 8gb or RAM is likely how this is done. 
  
  Do not buy this phone if you are looking just to get on the 5G service. I am on T-Mobile with my phone, and in all the testing I have done, it is barely faster than 4G service. Even when I am in sparsely populated areas where I have 5G connectivity, it was hardly different than 4G at all when I measured using speedtest.net. 
  
  Screen size, coming from a “larger” LG v30. I was initially not sure about how I would feel coming from a larger phone. Because google has a great design here, and have hidden away the speakers under the screen, and have a “pin-hole” camera, this phone’s screen is just about bezel less. So even though the phone might be physically smaller than a previous “larger” phone, it fits nearly the exact same screen size in smaller physical device. I really am happy with this. Less bulk in my pocket. Oh, and another great thing.. This thing has a beautiful OLED screen. To my eyes, it is better than my LG v30. 
  
  Speakers. They are not great, my old phone sounded better, but I cannot complain at all for things like listening to podcasts. Even music isn’t bad. Google went with a “under the screen” speaker, and it works, but it kind of gives you muddy sound for middle and bass tones. Again, it isn’t bad, and as for my personal use, it is fine. Gets just as loud as my old phone speakers. 
  
  Phone calls are great with this phone, whether via bluetooth headset, or speaker phone. No one I spoke with via any method of call had any issues hearing me. 
  
  “The gap”. Some people have them, and for those that do have a gap, some gaps are larger than others. There have been widespread reports, globally, that people are receiving Pixel 5s, with a slight gap between the screen and the body of the phone, most often, the gap is not uniform, and just in one corner of the phone. I unfortunately received my phone with this small gap in the top left edge corner of the phone. Google has stated that this gap is by “design”, but this more likely is just the result of during manufacturing, the adhesive used to seal the screen to the phone is just not holding down enough. Most people will not even notice the gap, but I was getting lint and dust stuck in that gap, while using the phone for the first couple of days before I moved along to a case for my phone. People on reddit have mentioned that after using the phone in a case for a few days, and the phone heating up, and pressure being applied by the case on to their phone gaps, that the adhesive likely is heating up again, and then applied with a good amount of pressure for the screen to seat down properly, as all phones should have come from the manufacturing line. I have found that this worked for me too! I cleaned out the dust and lint using a small plastic tool, and then put the phone in a case, and a day or two later, took the case off, and my top left corner gap is now gone. I really wish that google had better quality control at their manufacturing company, as this is something that should never have left their factories. After watching some breakdown videos, it seems highly unlikely that water or dust could have entered the internal sections of the phone, but when you are going to spend this much money on a device that is advertised as IP68, it is hard to see how this got back quality control on their assembly lines. 
  
  Fingerprint sensor only on this years Pixel 5 model. Face unlock has been removed from last years Pixel 4, and personally, I prefer having a fingerprint sensor. It just works, and due to the current global pandemic and mask wearing, THIS IS A HUGE plus!! You don’t have to fumble around pulling down your mask if you are in public. Pixel 4 did not have a fingerprint sensor at all. The fingerprint sensor generally works fine nearly everytime, but I did notice I had to change how I applied my finger with my third party case. Once I figured that spot out with the case on, it worked pretty much as well as with no case at all, which I would say is near perfect. 
  
  Cameras:
  These are awesome, and to be expected on any Pixel phone, and this phone is no different. Great photos from this phone, especially it’s night sight mode, and astrophotography modes! Setting photos to “portrait” in the camera app will also allow you to edit the lighting back in google photos on the phone, you can change the lighting, and even the bokeh blur in your photos this way. 
  
  Overall:
  Again, a great phone. I don’t need the fastest CPU in the world. If you don’t game directly on your phone, you probably don’t either. What you will most likely appreciate more is that slower processor will extend your battery life during the day, something that is more useful if you ask me. I know there were a bit of dings on my review of this phone, but hopefully going forward with future hardware manufacturing runs, google can improve quality control to make sure all phones out of the box do not have a gap. They have publicly said that this “gap” was there by “design”, but given that most people that do have a “gap”, it is not uniform all the way around, I am not so sure this is accurate. So I guess if that is true, by google’s own logic, if you have one with no “gap” you have a defective phone? Most people do not have a gap if you read various threads across the internet, and youtube videos. And even those that do, the gap for most is very small. Mine sealed up after having it in a case for a few days.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1

"I'm used to having a Motorola phone, and have always had an Android. My last Google phone was the Nexus 6, and I loved it. That was one of the largest phones, at the time, with a big 6"" screen. My previous phone before this Pixel 5, had been the Motorola Power G. Of all of the phones I have had, this pixel 5 seems to be the one with the most power packed into it. The display is great, as it is FHD+ (1080 x 2340) Flexible OLED at 432 ppi. The 90 hz makes it extremely smooth, while playing games. The Qualcomm® Snapdragon™ 765G 2.4 GHz + 2.2 GHz + 1.8 GHz, 64-bit Octa-Core also plays a key role in the fantastic performance. 
  
  The rear camera has a 12.2 MP dual-pixel camera, which is not the highest resolution out there, but the quality of photos in the dark is amazing. 4K video, at 30 and 60 frames per second is crystal clear. The front camera has an 8 MP at 1080p camera on it, which is really good for being a front camera these days. I am most impressed by the overall quality of the photos taken, especially with the focus and blur effects. I've always known iPhones to have great cameras, and Motorola was more of a budget photo camera, but the pixel 5 is just amazing to me. The included software to modify photos is a great addition. I haven't been always using snapseed, which is a Google product, but this new edit software allows for many more things than I'm used to. There's an option where you can pretty much add an additional light source or add Shadow direction to someone's face if you want. It's a nice when you have something that is not lit up like you want or add dramatization to the photo. The ability to adjust focus, blur and depth changing, post photo, is truly next level. It does not delay photos, nor does it make me choose if I want to select a specific style before I take the photo. in my other phones I always had to choose if I wanted the depth feature or not. But I felt like I would always miss the photo moment by having to adjust the focus prior to taking the photo period with this phone I just tell it I want to take the photo and then I can adjust it after the fact, like raw images in a DSLR camera. There's also a feature that allows you to make it look like the slow pan of professionally shot movies, and is really cool. There's a wide angle type lens that allows you to do 0.6x zoom. It is slightly distorted, but any wide angle lens zoom does that, so it's not a fault cover just something you would notice. After you take the photo on the bottom right area is a quick sharing, that you can click to share that photo to your Facebook or Instagram account, or whatever you would want. The HDR quality is out of this world. My phone camera does is go to quality as my DSLR does. 
  
  Charging this phone is actually quite quick, if you use the right charger. Well at my computer, I plugged it into a USB port on my monitor, and it charged extremely slowly. It's not a fast charger by any means, but I thought it would charge faster than it did. Plugging it into my monitor USB was basically not charging it. The provided phone charger is a USB type-c cord on both ends, and a USB type-c outlet plug, that charges it rapidly. I was really amazed at how fast it charged from really low level two nearly charged a short period of time. The battery has lasted me well over a day, with more than normal use. The only time it ever came close to dead, was when I gave my phone to one of my kids and they watched YouTube kids on it for a long time in the car ride. It still did not go to zero yet, in any day, so far. The lowest it seem is 9% level. 
  
  This may be a feature with Android update, but there's live caption in a settings option. It allows for captions on my screen for any video or video conference call. Thought that was a unique feature. In the settings when you swipe down from the top, it has a screen record feature. I had never seen that before, and it may be a Android operating system update, but it's really neat when trying to share something out with someone else. 
  
  
  I had never used the dark mode feature before this phone, and I never thought I would be a fan of it, until I tried it. I like that it uses less power and gets me through the days where I need to use it more often, but won't sacrifice battery life for using it. 
  
  For a home screen there is the top section that I cannot figure out how to remove or replace with home screen icons. It's like a heads up notification area for your next upcoming appointment or time and weather. The bottom section is also a Google Assistant search bar and both are required to stay, whereas my other phones I could use it for icon locations. When I tried setting up my phone for the first time I wanted to remove it but that did not happen. I'd rather use the swipe from the corner to call Google Assistant than have it show up on my screen taking up icon space. The swipe feature for the home screen previous and window selection took some time getting used to. I'm still not used to it after a week now. There's a little slider bar on the bottom screen that allows you to swipe from left to right and it goes to the previous screen. Pressing on the bottom and swiping upward and then still holding while toward the center of the screen, allows you to pull open the other windows. At that point you can swipe left and right on the windows to select your preference. If you want to eliminate that window then you would have to swipe up and it removes it. I'm used to a one button touch to pull up the windows and swipe away quickly, and this takes a little more time. I would always want to remove existing running Windows to free up ram, but this phone has not delayed on anything and I've had a lot open. I still get caught up sometimes swiping left to right in the center of the screen as the back button. Especially when I'm reading emails and I want to go back or forward. That's when it gets really tough and it will go to the next or previous email, when I want to go back to the previous view. Same thing goes for websites. 
  
  The only thing I miss with my old Motorola phones are the Moto actions where I can chop or twist to access the camera or turn the light on without turning on your phone. If I could somehow get those two features into this phone, it would be the best phone of all time for me. The still is the best phone I've had, but it would just be checking off every single box I would want in a phone. 
  
  On the back of the phone is a fingerprint sensor, that is very convenient. I've had them on the back and side, and don't have a preference as to which one is better. I do find that this sensor is a little bit more accurate than my other ones have been. Many apps use biometric fingerprint scanner to log in, and this one seems to have had only one time or didn't read my fingerprint correctly. My other phone seemed to be every 8-10 times I had to retry. 
  
  When I set up my phone initially, the cord that was provided, it allowed me to copy directly with a cord rather than download via Wi-Fi or the cloud period; it was extremely fast, and copied over my text messages and phone call records as well. In the past I had to always download a third party app to do so, and took forever, and several failed attempts to transfer, due to the size. This setup was probably the easiest I've had so far. With my Google account, it logged in and downloaded all my apps on my previous phone. It was probably because I switched from Motorola to the Google pixel 5, but my icons in my old phone were not transferred over to my new phone. Going from Motorola to motorola, they would, but not going from Motorola to Google pixel 5. I think that's just due to brands. In the box you also get a adapter if you have a USB type a phone, so you can still use the cord and connect them directly if your old phone is not a USB type-c connection, which is actually smart on their behalf. I'd say many people despise setting up new phones, and this takes a way that difficult step. 
  
  Depending on your area and reception, this has the capability to have 5G Network signal. When downloading anything on a 5G network, it's lightning fast. I've used the hotspot capability for my computer, my son's Nintendo switch, and my old phone for my daughter to watch in a car ride, and everything was great. I don't know if it was due to signal or not, but they lost connectivity from my hotspot when the phone was on a call and connected to Bluetooth in my car. As soon as I hung up then they got there internet signal back. It's unofficial but it happened twice coincidentally, I'm not sure. I haven't been able to find any information about downloading and phone calls at the same time. For those of you who have poor reception in your area, this phone also allows for Wi-Fi calling. If I'm in my basement, in certain areas, I get a lower signal, so the Wi-Fi calling really helps out in that scenario. 
  
  As far as sound quality, I did a comparison to my previous phone, and noticed while watching the exact same portion of a movie, the Pixel 5 sounds a little more muffled than my other one, but it also had a deeper sound to it. My other phone seemed more treble, where this one sound like it was slightly different speakers. My wife said she couldn't really tell the difference but I could. It's nothing that you would notice and say oh this is not good. The sound comes from the top and bottom of the phone, while I was playing a movie, and I think it was from the back as well, at least that's where it sounded like it was coming from. When I tested my first phone call, it sounded like the sound was coming from inside the top third of the phone and not necessarily just through the earpiece speaker on top. I feel like the sound may carry more, and others around me could hear it.

This is my first Pixel phone and I'm very happy with it. Good to get rid of the Samsung bloat after several years with a Galaxy. Battery life is good and camera is excellent. Haven't seen any issues with the processor. The main difference I noticed is the speaker behind the screen rather than a cut-out. Takes some getting used to but far from an issue.

"I'm a first time Pixel owner and the experience is so refreshing. Out of the box the phone is just so simple. I'm not fighting with samsung phones any longer. I don't want junk software installed. No facebook, instagram, twitter, alternative web browsers, app stores, or antivirus. What you get is an android phone with the correct default apps for things you want to do. Messages, email, etc are all built in google suite apps and work perfectly. Messages in fact is so powerful now because you can pull up your texts via web browser on any PC. When I'm at my computer desk I don't even need to touch my phone and it's so much easier to type and respond to clients who prefer SMS via the computer. I used to have a separate google voice number just for doing this, but now I no longer need to maintain that extra phone number. 
  
  The newest OS also has built in smart device shortcuts anchored on the power button, and because that makes using smart devices so easy I've added additional smart plugs and lights to my home. I truly feel like this phone has changed the way I operate daily with the smart device integration. Also google assistant is good, like REALLY GOOD. I no longer set alarms or timers manually. I tell google to do it for me. It saves me so much time, and I'm amazed by how much I can accomplish hands free. 
  
  The only complaint I have at all is that the ear speaker is under the glass which takes some getting used to and is not loud enough in some environments (like driving with loud road noise). This is easily remedied by using a bluetooth earpiece, and let's be honest most people have those if you truly want to do anything hands free so the ear speaker becomes a non issue.",0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0
"At first glance, you might think the Pixel 5 is a step back in some ways from the Pixel 4/4 XL. Technically you'd be correct on some fronts. But in actual usage, the Pixel 5 speeds along just as well and in some cases better. The camera hasn't really improved when it comes to still photography (although some would call the wide angle lens an improvement over the telephoto), but that still keeps it towards the top of the pile compared to other smartphone cameras. Video has gotten slightly better, but it still doesn't match up to its competitors. Battery life is fantastic, and in these pandemic times, the fingerprint sensor is a welcome change.

"For a $599 phone, it is amazing. I stepped up from a Pixel 2 XL and this has much better battery, I have gotten 3 days of my ""very light"" use, 2 days from my ""normal"" use, and a full day out of my ""heavy"" use. The Pixel 5 also has a much smoother screen (90hz refresh rate) that you can tell the difference when scrolling through stuff. The phone overall is smaller that my Pixel 2 XL which took a few days to get use to, especially when typing on the virtual keyboard but since I use swiftkey's keyboard, I was able to enlarge the keyboard slightly from what I typically have it set at, and now all is good. Keep in mind, even though the overall phone size is smaller, the screen size was almost identical to my last phone due to the very small bezel, just a different aspect ratio, no longer 16x9 but now more narrow. I am not the biggest fan of the punchhole front camera, but it has stayed out of the way thanks to the oversized status bar at the top. Which, by the way, is a waste of space, the status bar is twice as tall as it use to be which is to cover the area of the front camera. I wish they could have moved the camera up further allowing the status bar to be normal size. The back cameras are great, and using the wide angle lens for the first time in a narrow room, at first made the picture have a fish eyed look. But to my surprise, the phone adjusted the picture after taken and squared the room back up to look normal without distortion - very impressive (picture attached). Now they need to include all 3 cameras like most other flagship phones have. While I don't play games on my phone, everything else is super fast and you would never know it doesn't have the highest end processer. 5G was not that impressive, but that is due to Verizon not the phone. Maybe one day we'll see faster speeds. Love having wireless charging again (my Samsung Galaxy S6 had it, and boy did I miss it on my Pixel 2 XL), I use wireless charging to save the USB C port from being overly used which will provide a longer life span without charging issues. Be sure to get a 14 or 15 watt wireless charger so you can take advantage to the faster wireless charging speeds. My biggest gripe is the transfer process to a new phone, Google needs to step up their game and when doing a full transfer of the apps, should sign all apps into your accounts. Very few apps auto signed in, and I had to manually sign-in, get 2-step verification codes, reset passwords, and even locked myself out of a few accounts. That process takes too long, and is a pain. Lastly, I love the sage green color, I have a clear case and have had compliments on the color which at times looks turquoise.",1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

  Well from what I read latest Iphone and pixel 5 take best photos out and some say pixel 5 is better. 
  
  All I can say is WOW. On paper if you just read specs, this seams lower end with memory compared to flag ship samsung and CPU. 
  
  However the experience you get with Google Pure android is night and day difference. The Camera just works and takes some of the best photos I have ever seen. 
  
  Everything is lighting fast even though specs are lower than samsung phone I came from. This is due to Samsungs UI interface is so slow and just bogs the phone down. 
  
  WIFI is top notch, and the Google assistant call screening feature is a GOD SEND!

"It was a great phone until just after the return period expired, the volume of the speaker started fluctuating wildly. Doesn't matter whether it's being used as a phone or in any app; the volume will just randomly vary, oscillating over time. For example, say I set the volume at 50% on the phone's visual volume control. The volume indicator doesn't change, just the sound coming from the speaker drops to maybe as low as about 10% and then ten seconds or so later it surges up to somewhere higher than I set it. It also changes in tone -- when the volume drops it also loses all treble and sounds far away and muffled. For that reason I'm guessing it might even be a thermal issue pushing the speaker components around. Oh well, sad that it happened after the return period.

The pixel 4a 5g is an incredible phone and with the current discounts is the best value for money in terms of Pixel phones, maybe the best value period. The size is what led me to the Pixel 5, it was personally just too big for my hands. 
  
  Ok, so the Pixel 5 is an excellent phone. The size is perfect for me. The battery is phenomenal, it has a great camera, a beautiful screen, and the sound is better than ok despite some complaints in various reviews. It ticks every box and after a few days use, I haven't experienced anything that stands out as a glaringly obvious fault.",0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The pixel 5 is a good solid phone. I know many people point out at that this phone doesn't have the newest chipset but I notice no lag at all. It's fast and quick. The cameras are nice as advertised but as many other people have pointed out the volume is a issue. I think it's loud enough when watching YouTube and other apps but is fairly quiet for making calls even with the volume all the way up. The only other knock I have on the phone is that I can't screen mirror to my TV without WiFi.

"I upgraded to the Pixel 5 from the Galaxy S8 and the phone seems amazing so far. In terms of hardware, the biggest upgrade is the battery, which lasts much longer than my last phone. The software took about an hour to get used to, but once I was used to the interface, it seemed very natural. It has its ups and downs, but depending on how you use your phone, it can be very easy to get used to. 
  
  The largest reasons for getting this phone are for software and price since Google realize they can't compete with Samsung and Apple in terms of hardware specs. 
  
  The biggest problem I have is that it's the software doesn't naturally allow the user to re open background apps in the same way that the iPhone and the Galaxy phones would.

"Some people might think I am a little biased toward Google products since I am a long time Google fan! So far, I've been upgrading my phone every 2 year, sticking with the odd number edition. I started with Pixel, Pixel 3XL and now Pixel 5. 
  - 5G Speed: I am fortunate enough to live in San Diego where T-Mobile 5G is in majority places. I tested using Speedtest and it clocked in at 129Mbps download and 80.2Mbps upload! Impressive... 
  - Camera: what Google lacks in physical lens, it makes up in its software. 
  - UI: clean and no bloatware. Having said that, there are many new gestures that I am still getting used to. Given that I am switching over from Pixel 3XL, it's a bit surprising at the differences in the gestures. 
  - Storage: 128GB, Google does this right! 
  - Screen: When I switched from Pixel to Pixel 3XL, I remembered how happy I was to get more screen real estate, but there was always struggle in tucking my phone into my jeans front pocket. (I am 5'2""). Now, going back to 6"", it's really hard to scale back again. I really wish Google offered Pixel 5XL this year. 
  - Back cover: the material is a bit more plasticky than the smooth rubbery feel in Pixel 3XL.

"I received the Google Pixel 5 5G at no cost for an honest review. 
  My first impressions are good. The phone is very light to hold with smooth curves, but it is not slippery due to its lightly textured matte rear surface. The rear feels slightly plastic-y but not quite to the point where it feels cheap. 
  I was able to easily transfer most of my apps and settings with a guided process using an included USB-C cable. Coming from a different android phone, transfer was painless and took 8 minutes (50gb). After that, all the apps automatically downloaded and the Pixel was looking familiar again. 
  The fingerprint reader almost blends in with the back, and in my first few days of usage I kept accidentally touching the camera lens while searching for it. 
  The screen on this phone is beautiful. Watching even 1080P UHD videos on it is mesmerizing. The colors are vivid and true to life. The only caveat is that the front camera lens will be on the corner when you decide to expand your video to fill the whole screen. 
  Phone calls were normal, without anything to report. 
  Night photos with minimal light were beautiful. In fact, in the Pixel 5, I’d say the best feature is the camera (you could probably write a big manual on camera settings alone). With 12mp and 16mp ultrawide, you can get some large shots in, even at close range. In particular, I found the ability to do wide photos and wide selfies without having to move the camera handy. 
  One of my gripes is in fact the physical design of the camera on the phone itself. It sticks out of the phone, which means when you lay it on the counter with the screen side up, the camera lens will make contact with the surface (at least the bottom of it will). This is particularly annoying for those of us who don’t like to use cases. Placing the phone face down may not be a better solution either, but at least it’s completely flat on the screen side. This just means I’ll have to get a case. 
  My other minor gripe is the sound quality. Not that I expect much from cellphone speakers, but considering this is Google’s only phone, I expected better. Music sounds nasal in general. By the way, no headphone jack, if you care to know. 
  In terms of performance, the phone delivers and it is extremely responsive, even with 169 apps that I loaded on it. I like that it comes with 128 gigs, but I don’t like that it is not expandable. It has 5G and while I live in an area of California with AT&T 5G, I must say that there was no difference for me in terms of 4G and 5G speeds. I did not go in depth and only performed simple download/upload tests, so this may require more testing. 
  I noticed that every once in a while, the Wi-Fi would drop within my house. I’ll have to test it out more, but it was only happening with this phone. 
  Lastly, the battery did last me a few days with normal use, and, while I did not field test it, I can say that it is more efficient that anything I’ve used in the past, especially considering the small size of the phone. 
  Overall, I would recommend it, keeping in mind that it’s plenty for most people. However, if you like premium features such as heartrate sensors or a more premium-feeling shell, I’d go a different route.",1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

"I love the phone! I upgraded from Google Pixel 2.

I don't like these new gestures that replaced the soft back button (I end up swiping and incidentally deleting things when just trying to go back to the last page - since the gestures are identical), and last but biggest peeve Google Maps doesn't work (Waze works but Maps doesn't and I'm wondering did I just get a bad model?). Other than that I totally love the phone (Camera, battery life, video quality, *speed is comparable to Pixel 2, wireless charging, long list of latest Android things), just wish the audio and gestures were better so I could give it 5 stars, also wish I knew why Google Maps doesn't work on a Google phone.

"finally had the chance to have google pixel 5, been wanting to get this phone, friend of mine loved the camera that I told
  myself maybe once the new pixel comes out imma jump on the bandwagon! was it worth it switching from iphone let’s find out! 
  
  Pros
  - oddly enough coming from iphone for 6 years going back to android phone was pretty easy getting used to, first of all my personal work phone is an android device , having the new pixel 5 and the OS feels right at home
  - the outer design of pixel 5 was simple, man the back texture I thought it was weird at first, but it’s fantastic! the rough texture on the back makes you grip on the phone a lot better than smooth design like apple would have had
  - Pixel 5 feels lighter than my previous iphone 10 as well, having the tiny hole for front facing camera is a lot more pleasing that iphone notch
  - main reason I switch to android is to able to play Xbox Xcloud, my area does support 5g and my goodness, the jump on speed helps a lot on gaming on the go, I barely lag playing through cloud, the delay is very minimal. 5g signal help me a lot when using remote play on my xbox console to play on the go, using 4g on my previous iphone x, using remote play the audio of the game sounded so terrible and low quality, with 5g it boosted al that for better experience, 5g is the future! 
  - let’s talk about the camera coz the camera on Pixel 5g is amazing, the color is balance, it doesn’t look saturated like I see on samsung phone, this probably the main thing I was excited to finally try, taking picture at night is way better than my iphone x , self portrait looks clean and way more controlled blur compared to iphone x. this phone also have ultra wide shot, I don’t remember having this on my iphone x so it’s a first for me! 
  - snapdragon is pretty fast smooth, didn’t notice any slow from testing the speed form scrolling to switching and opening/ closing apps
  - for the price of pixel 5 and the features you get compare to more high end phones is amazing! 
  - battery experience on this phone is great, this phone last longer than my previous phone! i’m on my phone a lot, so having this long battery life it helps on experience having this phone
  
  Cons
  - the audio of this phone is prob the main thing that bother me, it reminds me of Sony OLED tv where the screen audio is inside the glass, but my older iphone X had a much louder sounds than this pixel 5, like why did they choose to do this? it’s actually terrible specially if you put it side by side to a different phone, I could prob get a cheaper phone than pixel 5 and would find something that it’s way better quality than this. very disappointed. 
  - Snapdragon 765g is great and all but in 2020 I would hope for a better processor, maybe they trying to balance a price difference but still maybe i’m just being too picky 
  - you might want to re think buying this phone coz you pretty much will have the exact same experience when buying Pixel 4
  
  you prob ask why not just buy iphone 12 when they both the same price? i’m a huge gamer and when iphone announced that xcloud was not gonna be supported, I had to switch to an android phone, but this phone is fantastic! it’s easy to use, comes with great features that I need, and I doubt I would miss switching back to apple.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1

"This is my first Pixel and I have to say that I'm really impressed. For a device not running a flagship 800 series processor, it's really fast and responsive, probably due to that 90 hertz refresh rate.

I received this item for giving a honest review. It seems like a very nice phone out of the box ii smaller than my current phone but I like it better too. It was easy to set up and get started. I used this as my primary phone and my carrier has 5G here and was able to get a 5G signal. It was fast and make me wish I had purchased my own.

"I've been using iPhones since their original release and occasionally tried Android phones here and there. In my younger years, the fomo of not having iMessage and FaceTime locked me into using Apple products for many years. I was using the iPhone XS Max before getting this device and my wife is using the iPhone 12. 
  
  Enough history, now about the device. 
  
  The 90hz display and minimal hole punch for the selfie cam is both a delight to use and look at. I was absolutely tired of the notch. Speaking of the notch, face ID during COVID was extremely annoying while wearing face masks. I genuinely really appreciate that Google went back to finger print scanners and ditched the face unlock from the pixel 4. Battery life is 10/10, I went 32 hours on one charge with 6.5 hours of screen time. I couldn't kill the phone if I tried. Also, the Google specific assistant features like call screen, auto hold, and other features are godsend with all these spam calls I keep getting. Most of my family have iPhones but over the years transitioned to whatsapp so I no longer worry about not having iMessage. I used to care about it for work, but after being stuck home, everyone now uses Zoom and MS Teams so I finally broke free from apples walled garden. As a father, husband, son and even business professional. Life's too short to use a device just to please other people. Pictures are excellent and still don't know how these night photos work. Dont worry about the snapdragon 765 as it performs so well I don't even notice a performance difference between this and the 8xx series snapdragons.

  The battery life is beyond expectations. Having been used to being tethered to my charger, the Pixel 5 can last for days at a time before hitting battery saver with lighter use, and can coast through overnight from 90->45% with several hours of SOT, and always-on display.

I don't play games, so the Snapdragon 765G didn't bother me too much. The phone symmetry is beautiful, uniform bezels, holepunch camera, form factor, and a nice textured back. The fingerprint sensor and the camera are the best in any device I have ever used. The camera sensor may be old but once you go Pixel, it's hard to use any other camera. The battery life is incredible and the standout feature of this phone. I got 8 hours of screen on time with a single charge, blew my mind. My 3 XL got like 4-5 hours max. The only negative is the speaker. There are two down firing speakers that sound fine, but another behind the glass screen and it sounds terrible.

"For a $599 phone, it is amazing. I stepped up from a Pixel 2 XL and this has much better battery, I have gotten 3 days of my ""very light"" use, 2 days from my ""normal"" use, and a full day out of my ""heavy"" use. The Pixel 5 also has a much smoother screen (90hz refresh rate) that you can tell the difference when scrolling through stuff. The phone overall is smaller that my Pixel 2 XL which took a few days to get use to, especially when typing on the virtual keyboard but since I use swiftkey's keyboard, I was able to enlarge the keyboard slightly from what I typically have it set at, and now all is good. Keep in mind, even though the overall phone size is smaller, the screen size was almost identical to my last phone due to the very small bezel, just a different aspect ratio, no longer 16x9 but now more narrow. I am not the biggest fan of the punchhole front camera, but it has stayed out of the way thanks to the oversized status bar at the top. Which, by the way, is a waste of space, the status bar is twice as tall as it use to be which is to cover the area of the front camera. I wish they could have moved the camera up further allowing the status bar to be normal size. The back cameras are great, and using the wide angle lens for the first time in a narrow room, at first made the picture have a fish eyed look. But to my surprise, the phone adjusted the picture after taken and squared the room back up to look normal without distortion - very impressive. Now they need to include all 3 cameras like most other flagship phones have. While I don't play games on my phone, everything else is super fast and you would never know it doesn't have the highest end processer. 5G was not that impressive, but that is due to Verizon not the phone. Maybe one day we'll see faster speeds. Love having wireless charging again (my Samsung Galaxy S6 had it, and boy did I miss it on my Pixel 2 XL), I use wireless charging to save the USB C port from being overly used which will provide a longer life span without charging issues. Be sure to get a 14 or 15 watt wireless charger so you can take advantage to the faster wireless charging speeds. My biggest gripe is the transfer process to a new phone, Google needs to step up their game and when doing a full transfer of the apps, should sign all apps into your accounts. Very few apps auto signed in, and I had to manually sign-in, get 2-step verification codes, reset passwords, and even locked myself out of a few accounts. That process takes too long, and is a pain.",1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

"To me, there is a singular reason for buying a Pixel phone: Software. The software experience on a Pixel device is simply unparalleled. Simple but thoughtful additions enhance the user experience. One of these features, call screening, is absolutely amazing. It's one of the most powerful tools in battling spam calls. The Pixel line has had a somewhat troubled history, but I think Google has made a wise decision in chasing value as opposed to industry-leading specs. While the Pixel 5 doesn't pack the latest processor, its performance is unquestionably more than capable for most users. The simplicity of the software combined with the 90 Hz display makes the Pixel 5 feel fluid and fast in everyday use. Additionally, Google seems to have finally taken battery life seriously. After the dismal battery life of the Pixel 4 lines, Google has sported the Pixel 5 with a much larger battery that, combined with the mid-range processor, makes this phone leave any battery life concerns in the past. While I liked face unlock with the Pixel 4, I find the fingerprint sensor on the Pixel 5 to be fast and accurate and, if I am going to use a fingerprint sensor, I much prefer it to be located on the back of the device rather than embedded in the screen (I actually miss LG's old approach of integrating the fingerprint sensor with the power button on the back of the phone). Not surprisingly, the camera is still impressive although, admittedly, the camera is one of the lowest priorities on a smartphone for me; But, if a good camera is a priority for you, you'll find it on the Pixel 5. The phone's design is a bit uninspired and utilitarian but, slap one of Google's nice fabric cases on it and the phone gets some personality. The screen is excellent - minimal bezels with a small hole punch camera on the left. Sound on the Pixel 5 is a bit underwhelming, and this is likely due to there being no true top speaker (google uses the screen itself as a speaker, much like LG did with the LG G8). Call clarity is perfectly fine, but music can sound a bit muffled - this is not a big deal for me because I used wireless headphones 99% of the time I listen to music. If you are looking for the latest hardware and top of the line specs, the Pixel 5 is not for you; but, if you are looking for an unparalleled software experience wrapped in a manageable form factor, the Pixel 5 is definitely worth a look.",1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

  No, it's not the fastest, flashiest phone ever, but it's never slowed down on me for what I use it for (messaging, web browsing, the occasional light game) and the battery is honestly darn near impossible to kill in a single day (I've done it, but it involved shamefully binging a mobile game for like 8 hours...). 
  
  The unmodified version of Android is snappy, clean and efficient. The camera is great, with an amazing suit of editing software that lets you tweak just about anything you could possibly want shy of importing the photo into adobe photoshop.

Yes, no case, no screen protector. This phone is durable. I've dropped it several times onto bare concrete floors at work several times and this ring doesn't have a scratch on it.

  No headphone jack (not a huge deal for me, but it's notable)

Easy and intuitive user interface. Fast. Water proof: I accidentally spilled water over the phone and was prompted with a message that 'USB port is deactivated from debris or water. you will be notified when the USB port is ready to use'. I was not able to use USB port but later received a message that the USB port is ready to use and I verified the port functioned normally again. Camera/Photo quality is superior (and natural) compared to new iPhone which somehow showed an added bright blue shade to all photos.,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"This is my 3rd Pixel (1,3 & 5). They have all been good. The pixel 5 addressed a battery life issue that plagued previous versions. This is, by far, the best value android phone that is out there.

"I am biased to start. I really like Google phones. The pure ""Google"" version of Android with constant safety updates is comforting. It looks like Google finally figured out battery life.

"While I am a fan of the Pixel Line, this Pixel 5 has such a bad Phone Speaker, that I had to return it. To help you understand, the ""earpiece"" for the phone speaker is under the glass of the phone. There is no external speaker! Therefore, when you are on a call and the other person is talking, the entire phone vibrates, making it VERY annoying to have a conversation. Also, because the speaker is under the glass, the sound for music, videos, etc. is also very poor. The bottom speaker is good enough, but gets muffled with the combo of the under glass speaker. The other features of this phone are why I originally purchased it, and they are what makes the Pixel my favorite phone. Unfortunately, this one HUGE design flaw made me return it. Sure hoping they fix this with the Pixel 6!",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

"After owning numerous versions of the Pixel line, I think Google finally got it right.

This phone is just like the reviews say. It is on a better budget than some other phones. It offers almost everything you would ask for in a phone. Offering water resistance wireless charging good storage and memory along with a couple of great cameras. I also like that the phone is not glass I am not sure who made up the premium market or who drives it but that is farce in my book. I think premium is something like this with grip a good clean look and something you do not have to worry about breaking easy. I also like how they finally slimed down the phone and fit a lot into a small package. I would have like to see a bigger screen because of it but I am ok with what this gives you. I am surprised at how good the audio works on this phone considering how it is produced. You would not know the processor is not the top end because this phone performs all day every day very very well. I also like that I use it every day playing games and work and still only charge it about every day and a half. I think the screen refresh rate and resolution are perfect again the companies trying to go bigger make no sense. This is not a tv and you can only see things up to certain specs and this is about it. It also helps the battery last longer which with how small this phone is I would be ok with it being a little thicker with a bigger battery to get a couple of days out of a charge. The only negative things I can say for the phone is I wish it did have the 3 cameras with wide normal and telephoto like others along with the option for a bigger screen.,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

"I bought the Verizon carrier-locked version when it was on sale for $500 and, I couldn't be happier! 
  
  This has been the perfect replacement for my Pixel 2. I have not experienced any slowness with the 765G and, the wide-angle lens has been great for both photo and video. 
  
  Additionally, it has fixed my number one issue with the pixel line, battery life. I can now comfortably take my phone off its charger and know it is going to last me 24+ hours. 
  
  Finally, I was relieved to see that, even on the carrier-specific version, there was no bloatware other than the Verizon account management app, which can easily be uninstalled. 
  
  I would highly recommend this to anyone not wanting to shell out $1000 for a new phone to pick this phone up.",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
